answer:  To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

The amount of blue fiber is given as 2 bolts.
The amount of white fiber is half as much as the blue fiber, so it is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is:
2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts.

answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the distance James runs in one day.
3. Calculate the distance James runs in one week.

First, let's find the distance James runs in one sprint:
- James runs 60 meters per sprint.

Next, let's calculate the distance James runs in one day:
- James runs 3 sprints per day.
- Each sprint is 60 meters.
- Therefore, in one day, he runs \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) meters.

Now, let's calculate the distance James runs in one week:
- James runs 3 times a week.
- Each day he runs 180 meters.
- Therefore, in one week, he runs \( 3 \times 180 = 540 \) meters.

So, the total distance James runs in a week is \( 540 \) meters.

#### 540

Therefore, James runs 540 meters in a week.

answer:  To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends.
3. Calculate the number of eggs left to sell.
4. Multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to find the daily earnings.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she eats a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.
3. The number of eggs left to sell is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs she eats, which is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs per day.
4. She sells each egg for $2, so her daily earnings are the number of eggs sold multiplied by the price per egg, which is 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18 per day.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

Final answer: $18

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the house after the repairs:
- Initial cost: $80,000
- Repairs: $50,000
- Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Next, let's calculate the new value of the house after the 150% increase:
- Original value: $80,000
- Increase: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
- New value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- New value: $200,000
- Total cost: $130,000
- Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of \boxed{70,000}.

answer:  To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to calculate the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together have 260 sheep.

answer:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \( 0.6 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.

So, for each pair of glasses, the total cost is \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) dollars.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to determine how many pairs of glasses he has to pay for. Each pair consists of 2 glasses, so Kylar will buy:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:

\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

answer:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, we need to add the 20 minutes taken for the restart to install updates:

40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Finally, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 = 120 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

So, the total time to download the file is:

60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

answer:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for all the chickens in a day.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens. Therefore, the total amount of feed required in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed Wendi has already given:
- Morning feed: 15 cups
- Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Adding these together, the total amount of feed given so far is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount of feed required in a day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

answer:  To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Therefore, the total cost is $694.

   - Calculation: \(3 \times 60 = 180\)

3. **Third Month:**
   - Downloads: Reduced by 30% from the second month
   - Calculation: First, find 30% of 180, which is \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\). Then, subtract this from 180 to get the number of downloads in the third month: \(180 - 54 = 126\)

Now, add up the downloads for all three months:
\[ 60 \text{ (first month)} + 180 \text{ (second month)} + 126 \text{ (third month)} = 366 \]

Therefore, the program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months.

answer:  Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours is $10. Therefore, her earnings for the first 40 hours are:
\[ 40 \times 10 = 400 \]

Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week. The number of overtime hours is:
\[ 45 - 40 = 5 \]

Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Since her regular hourly rate is $10, her overtime rate is:
\[ 1.2 \times 10 = 12 \]

Therefore, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

To find her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings from the first 40 hours to her earnings from the overtime hours:
\[ 400 + 60 = 460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

answer:  To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each segment of his trip and then sum these distances.

1. **First segment:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance: 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Second segment:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Distance: 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

3. **Third segment:**
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles

Now, we sum the distances from each segment:
- Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 80 miles = 275 miles

Since John turned around after the first segment, he is 275 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours.

Therefore, John is 275 miles away from home.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \times \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners.
4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so \( \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Solving for \( x \):

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with \( 18 \) vacuum cleaners.

answer:  To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then figure out how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50
- Cost to water and feed the tree: $3

Net profit per year = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Next, we need to determine how many years it will take to cover the initial planting cost of $90:

- Initial planting cost: $90
- Net profit per year: $7.50

Number of years needed = Initial planting cost / Net profit per year
Number of years needed = $90 / $7.50
Number of years needed = 12

Since Carlos needs to earn at least $90 to cover the initial planting cost, it will take him 12 years to start earning money. Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from the lemon tree.

answer:  First, let's determine the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour for the next 2 miles.
- Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Next, let's determine the total distance she needs to cover:
- The entire trail is 12 miles.
- She has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
- Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

We need her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire trail. Therefore, the total time she needs to complete the trail is:
- Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, let's determine the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
- Speed = Distance / Time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine Raymond's age when he had his son.
3. Calculate the number of years since Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth was:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old and his son was born when Raymond was 2 years old, the number of years since Raymond's son was born is:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

Adding these together:
\[ $12 + $15 + $6 = $33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizzas is:
\[ $50 - $33 = $17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizzas by the cost per box:
\[ $17 \div $8.50 \]

Performing the division:
\[ $17 \div $8.50 \approx 1.9574 \]

Since Marie cannot order a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Let \( x \) be Darrell's current age and \( 11x \) be Allen's current age, given the ratio of their ages is 7:11.

The sum of their ages is given as 162:
\[ x + 11x = 162 \]
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Darrell's current age is 9 years, and Allen's current age is:
\[ 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20 more than 80, so 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240 jelly beans.

To find \( P \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Calculate the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = \frac{19.50 \times 10}{0.75 \times 10} = \frac{195}{7.5} = \frac{195}{6} = 26 \]

1. Determine how many jewels Aaron has.
2. Use the information about Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.

First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has:
- Raymond has 40 jewels.
- Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.

Calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

Now, add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

\[ S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's calculate the points he scores in the second 20 minutes:

answer:  First, let's determine the total time John runs in a week.

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So, his running speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

answer:  To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between the point of his first stop and the point of his second stop.

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. The first stop was after 20 miles.
3. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, let's find the distance from the start of the trip to the second stop:
- The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.
- Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop is at 45 miles (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

Now, we calculate the distance between the first and second stops:
- The first stop is at 20 miles.
- The second stop is at 45 miles.

The distance between the first and second stops is:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled **25 miles** between his first and second stops.

answer:  To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of pie.
2. Subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of pie:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 26.

answer:  If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
If Dana spends one-third of the time running, then she spends 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours running.
If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, then she spends 6 * 2/3 = 4 hours walking.
The distance she travels while running is distance * speed * time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
The distance she travels while walking is distance * speed * time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.
The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

answer:  John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he makes 13 * $15 = $<<13*15=195>>195.
He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so he spends 8 * $20 = $<<8*20=160>>160.
He has $5 left after buying the video games, so he spent $160 + $5 = $<<160+5=165>>165 on video games.
Since he had $195 from selling the lego sets and spent $165 on video games, he still has $195 - $165 = $<<195-165=30>>30 left.
Since he sold each lego set for $15, he can buy $30 / $15 = <<30/15=2>>2 more lego sets with the remaining money.
Therefore, he still has 13 sets he sold + 2 more sets he bought = <<13+2=15>>15 lego sets.

answer:  To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.
2. Multiply the total daily time by the number of days in a week to get the total weekly time.

First, let's calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
- John takes care of 10 dogs.

So, the total daily time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we multiply the total daily time by the number of days in a week to get the total weekly time:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total weekly time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

The answer is 35.

answer:  To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance to which Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
2. Determine how much farther this distance is compared to the reach of the dragon's flames.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we compare this distance to the reach of the dragon's flames, which is 1000 feet:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

answer:  To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total calories in a 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left to reach your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.

First, let's calculate the total calories in a 300g bag of chips:
- Each serving contains 250 calories.
- A 300g bag has 5 servings.
- Total calories in a 300g bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Next, we determine how many calories are left to reach your daily calorie target:
- Daily calorie target = 2000 calories
- Calories already consumed = 1800 calories
- Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Since you have already consumed 1800 calories and you only have 200 calories left, you cannot eat any more chips with the remaining calories.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, we sum up the number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write:
- Total hours = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of all the ties. John buys 5 blue ties and 10 red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost} = (5 \times 40) + (10 \times 60) = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs produced per week is 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs.

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Therefore, the total number of dozens is 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
- Therefore, the total revenue is 147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294.

So, Lloyd makes $294 from the sale of eggs per week.

answer:  To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie visit and then divide that by the total amount of money he has.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is also $7. Therefore, the total cost for one movie visit is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie visit:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

answer:  To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. Cost for the material: $500
2. Cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch: $800
3. Insurance cost: 10% of the cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch

First, let's calculate the insurance cost:
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = \left(\frac{10}{100}\right) \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for material} + \text{Cost for jeweler} + \text{Insurance cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 500 + 800 + 80 = 1380 \]

answer:  If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000.
If she quits after 30 years, she will have worked for 40 - 30 = 10 years.
For the first 10 years, she will receive an annual pension of $50,000.
So for the first 10 years, her pension will be $50,000 * 10 = $500,000.
For the remaining 10 years, she will receive 5% of the value of the pension per year.
So for the next 10 years, her pension will be $50,000 * 5% = $25,000 per year.
And for the next 10 years, her pension will be $25,000 * 10 = $250,000.
Therefore, her total pension for the entire period will be $500,000 + $250,000 = $750,000.

answer:  To determine the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

1. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.
2. **Unripe oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. Since there are 25 oranges in total, we calculate:
   \[
   0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.
3. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \text{ oranges}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, in one day, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week. He does this 3 times a week:

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total number of gems:**
   - Add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

answer:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of miles Sophia can drive per gallon of gas.
2. Multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank to find the total miles she can drive on a full tank.

First, let's find out how many miles Sophia can drive per gallon of gas. She traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we know that Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank:

\[ \text{Total miles} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

answer:  To find the average square footage of a level in the 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. The second level has half the square footage of the top level, so it has a square footage of \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
3. The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it has a square footage of \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
4. The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it has a square footage of \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

Now, we sum up the square footage of all four levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average:
\[ \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5.

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the total number of students at the school:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Given that there are 5 students for every teacher, we can set up the following equation to find the number of teachers:

answer:  Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost for the cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

The interest rate is 2% for each cell phone, so the interest for each cell phone is:
\[ 150 \times 0.02 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total interest for all five cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The total amount Shiela will pay over the 3 months is the sum of the total cost and the total interest:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Since the installment is over 3 months, the monthly payment is:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

- Revenue from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $<<23*4=92>>92

Now, we add the revenue from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
- Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
- Total revenue = $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221

Therefore, Tommy raises $221 from selling 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake.

For the first 180 days, 1 cup of dog food is fed every day:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the remaining days of the year, 2 cups of dog food are fed every day. There are 365 days in a year, so:

Given:
- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Let's calculate Alex's weight:

1. Calculate 4 times Grace's weight:

\]
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498

answer:  To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the annual increase in salary.
2. Determine the total increase in salary over three more years.
3. Add the total increase to her initial salary to find her new annual salary.

First, let's calculate the annual increase in salary. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary each year.

Initial salary = $600
Annual increase = 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60

Next, let's determine the total increase in salary over three more years.

Total increase = Annual increase * Number of years
Total increase = $60 * 3 = $180

Finally, let's add the total increase to her initial salary to find her new annual salary.

New annual salary = Initial salary + Total increase
New annual salary = $600 + $180 = $780

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $780.

answer:  To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacations he goes on each year.
3. Calculate the total number of vacation events.
4. Conclude that the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacation events.

First, calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:
- Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
- He is currently 34 years old.
- Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Next, determine the number of vacations he goes on each year:
- Gene goes on 4 vacations per year.

Now, calculate the total number of vacation events:
- Total vacation events = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
- Total vacation events = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacation events.

Since each vacation event corresponds to one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is:
- Total quilt blocks = 44 vacation events.

answer:  First, let's determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl received 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water received by the girls is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we add the amount of water received by the boy. The boy received 6 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water received by both the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water received by the girls and the boy from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left. The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water left is \boxed{10} liters.

answer:  To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each occurrence and then sum them up.

1. **First occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first occurrence lasted 4 rings, the second occurrence lasted \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) rings.

3. **Third occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second occurrence lasted 12 rings, the third occurrence lasted \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) rings.

Now, we sum up the rings from all three occurrences:
- First occurrence: 4 rings
- Second occurrence: 12 rings
- Third occurrence: 6 rings

Total rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

\[ \text{Total invited} = 16 \]

Next, determine how many friends don't show up:
\[ \text{Guests who don't show up} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

Now, calculate the number of friends who actually show up:
\[ \text{Guests who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, so the total number of gift bags required is:
\[ \text{Total gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

So, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the Girl Scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

Finally, to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:

answer:  Let's denote the number of games the football team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the football team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]

The football team won 15 games.

answer:  To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the amount required for the adults and the children separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Adults:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total potato salad for adults = 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

2. **Children:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult.
   - Since an adult eats 10 pounds, a child eats 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total potato salad for children = 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

3. **Total potato salad needed:**
   - Total potato salad = Total potato salad for adults + Total potato salad for children
   - Total potato salad = 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants after giving away 1 potted plant from each ledge.

answer:  To determine Gerald's new time after his improved diet, we first need to find out how long Gerald originally took to run the 400-meter hurdles.

Given:
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
- Lee used to run the hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.

Let \( G \) be the time Gerald originally took to run the 400-meter hurdles. Therefore,
\[ 38 = G - 2 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald originally took 40 seconds to run the 400-meter hurdles.

Gerald's improved diet reduces his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 90% of his original time:
\[ \text{New time} = 0.90 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

answer:  Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald's record as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11H = 88000 \]

To find \( H \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88000}{11} \]

Calculate the division:

\[ H \approx 7909.09 \]

Since the number of copies sold must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number:

\[ H \approx 7909 \]

Therefore, Harald sold approximately 7,909 copies of his record.

The final answer is:

\[ 7909 \]

1. **Number of dogs:**
   - Given that the number of dogs is 60.

2. **Number of cats:**
   - There are two cats for every dog.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

3. **Number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.
   - So, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \boxed{348}.

answer:  To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover and then use the rate at which it covers that distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, let's find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \text{Number of segments} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover each segment. Therefore, the total time to cover 14 segments is:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans are needed, we divide the initial volume by the volume of each can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces per can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Finally, each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

answer:  Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining was \( 30 - x \).

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining became \( (30 - x) - 20 = 10 - x \).

Then, 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars remaining became \( (10 - x) - 5 = 5 - x \).

We are given that after these events, there are still 0 cars left on the motorway. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 - x = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5 - x = 0 \]
\[ 5 = x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

First, let's find the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

**Weekdays:**
- John drinks a glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks a glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks a glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks a glass of water before bed.

So, in one weekday, John drinks:

answer:  To determine how many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy places.
2. Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her share.
3. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy's mom places.
4. Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy's mom places her share.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

2. The number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her share:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

4. The number of pieces left to be placed is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the gas without cashback:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cashback amount:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Finally, subtract the cashback from the total cost to find the final amount:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the total cost after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

answer:  First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of each box after accounting for the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches (1 inch from each side) = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = Length × Width × Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the boards:

- Cost of ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $10 = $100
- Cost of five 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, let's determine the new prices after the 50% increase:

- New price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board: $10 * 1.5 = $15
- New price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board: $16 * 1.5 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:

- Total revenue = (10 * $15) + (5 * $24) = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

answer:  To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate.

Beatrice's roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long:
\[ 2 \text{ roll-ups} \times 24 \text{ roll-ups} = 48 \text{ roll-ups} \]

Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long:
\[ 3 \text{ roll-ups} \times 14 \text{ roll-ups} = 42 \text{ roll-ups} \]

Next, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 \text{ roll-ups} + 42 \text{ roll-ups} = 90 \text{ roll-ups} \]

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ roll-ups}}{2} = 45 \text{ roll-ups} \]

So, the average number of roll-ups they ate is 45 roll-ups.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to make \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

To verify, he intended to make 100 cookies, baked 115 cookies, and after dropping 5, has 110 cookies, which matches the given total.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Total fruits brought by Morisette:
5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: 2 * 5 = 10 apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: 8 / 2 = 4 oranges

Total fruits brought by Kael:
10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Now, we add the fruits brought by Morisette and Kael:
13 fruits + 14 fruits = 27 fruits

Therefore, Morisette and Kael have a total of 27 fruits.

answer:  Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \). According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so:

\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30000 \]

So, Lylah earned $30,000 four years ago.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:

\[ 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000 \]

Lylah's salary remained the same, so her new salary is still $30,000.

The total salary they are receiving four years later is:

\[ 56000 + 30000 = 86000 \]

Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah are receiving four years later is $86,000.

answer:  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and it can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, then Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \text{ photographs} \]

According to the problem, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let \( x \) represent the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ 50x + 50x = 300 \text{ photographs} \]

Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation:

\[ 100x = 300 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{300}{100} = 3 \]

So, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 3. Therefore, the number of ducks seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is:

answer:  To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and the remaining time at 5 miles per hour.

1. **First 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Remaining time at 5 miles per hour:**
   - Total time: 7 hours
   - Time spent at 10 miles per hour: 3 hours
   - Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

**Total distance:**
- Total distance = Distance from the first 3 hours + Distance from the remaining time
- Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run **50 miles** in 7 hours.

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles from the first day.
2. Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, let's calculate the total number of vehicles from the first day:
- There are 2 containers.
- Each container contains 5 vehicles.
- Total vehicles on the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

Next, we know the total number of vehicles after the second day is 30.
- Total vehicles after the second day = 30 vehicles.
- Vehicles added on the second day = 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can calculate the number of containers imported on the second day:
- Number of containers imported on the second day = Vehicles added on the second day / Vehicles per container = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

Therefore, 4 containers of vehicles were imported on the second day.

answer:  To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we first need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

The total number of parts in the ratio is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. This means the total number of parts in the ratio is also 20.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of teaspoons by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons} \]

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts. Therefore, we multiply the value of one part by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons} \]

So, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6 \) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) hours.

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.
There is a 20% delivery fee, so the delivery fee is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.
Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the total cost of the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.
Therefore, the total cost of her delivery order is $29.00.

answer:  A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so each watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so each orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.
Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
The total cost for the watermelons is 4 * $45 = $<<4*45=180>>180.
The total cost for the peppers is 20 * $15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The total cost for the oranges is 10 * $40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $<<180+300+400=880>>880.

answer:  To determine the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the number of pink gumballs as \( p \). According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. We know there are 12 blue gumballs.

The relationship between the number of pink gumballs and blue gumballs can be expressed as:
\[ p = 4 \times \text{number of blue gumballs} + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we substitute 12 for the number of blue gumballs:
\[ p = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

First, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Then, we add 22 to 48:
\[ 48 + 22 = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is:
\[ p = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

answer:  To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of car washes Tom gets in a year.
2. Calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year.

First, let's find out how many car washes Tom gets in a year:
- Tom gets 4 car washes per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of car washes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year:
- Each car wash costs $15.
- There are 48 car washes in a year.

So, the total cost in a year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

answer:  Let's denote the number of queen bees as \( Q \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).

There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queen bees.

The number of worker bees is \( 4Q \):
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

The answer is 400.

answer:  To determine the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred, we need to calculate the tickets used for the roller coaster rides and the luge rides separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Roller coaster tickets:**
   - Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
   - Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
   - Each roller coaster ride costs 6 tickets.
   - Total tickets for roller coaster rides = 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride + 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets + 24 tickets = 36 tickets.

2. **Luge tickets:**
   - Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times.
   - Each luge ride costs 6 tickets.
   - Total tickets for luge rides = 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride + 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets + 12 tickets = 24 tickets.

3. **Total tickets used:**
   - Total tickets = 36 tickets (roller coaster) + 24 tickets (luge) = 60 tickets.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we need to calculate the tax amount. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the total cost before tax by 10% (or 0.10):

Tax amount = $15 * 0.10 = $1.50

Finally, we add the tax amount to the total cost before tax to find the total cost including tax:

Total cost including tax = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

So, the total cost of everything, including tax, is $16.50.

- Time: 8 hours
- Questions completed: 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions
- Questions left incomplete for the first test: 75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed for the second test:
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time: 6 hours
- Questions completed: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions
- Questions left incomplete for the second test: 100 questions - 30 questions = 65 questions

Now, let's add the number of questions left incomplete from both tests:
- Total questions left incomplete: 35 questions + 65 questions = 100 questions

answer:  To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars.

Given:
- Total number of cars = 20
- Number of automatic cars = 12
- Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

- 30 bees leave the hive.

Next, let's calculate how many bees returned in the next 6 hours:
- She sees 1/2 as many bees return as left.
- Therefore, 15 bees return.

Now, let's calculate how many bees left the hive in the next 6 hours:
- She sees two times as many bees leave as she saw initially.
- Therefore, 60 bees leave.

Finally, let's determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours:
- Every bee that left before and hadn't already returned returns.
- The bees that left before included the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours and the 60 bees that left in the next 6 hours.
- Therefore, 30 + 60 = 90 bees return.

So, the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
- 15 (returned) + 90 = 105 bees.

answer:  To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many friends Dorothy has.
2. Use the number of friends Dorothy has to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has 12 friends and that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 12 \]

To find the number of friends Dorothy has, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that Dorothy has four times as many friends as James. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the number of friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The number of fries remaining after each pigeon ate three fries is \( 14 + 7 - 3 \times 3 = 14 + 7 - 9 = 22 \) fries.
4. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 22 = 14 \) fries.
5. The number of fries remaining after the raccoon ate is \( 22 - 14 = 8 \) fries.
6. The ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. Therefore, the ants carried off 6 fries (since 8 - 5 = 3).

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is the sum of the remaining fries and the fries taken by the ants, which is \( 8 + 6 = 14 \) fries.

So, Kelly runs a total of 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards.
In total, Kelly runs 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.
The winner runs 2920 yards, and the loser runs 2500 yards.
The difference in distance is 2920 yards - 2500 yards = 420 yards.

1. **Cost of the red cars:**
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Total cost of red cars = 5 \times 4 = $20.

2. **Cost of the action figures:**
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Total cost of action figures = 3 \times 5 = $15.

3. **Cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost of the doll = 3 \times 5 = $15.

4. **Total cost of all toys:**

answer:  To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish they caught and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of fish Locsin caught:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) starfish.
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) sea horses.
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both:
- Anakin's total: \( 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \) fish
- Locsin's total: \( 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \) fish

Total number of fish caught by both: \( 19 + 13 = 32 \) fish

answer:  Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \).
Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

answer:  To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase for each two-month period and then apply that increase to the original price.

1. **Initial Price:**
   The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Every Two Months:**
   The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price after 2 months} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]

3. **Total Price After 36 Months:**
   Since there are 18 two-month periods in 36 months, we need to calculate the price after 18 periods.
   \[
   \text{Price after 36 months} = 24 \times 18 = 432
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be $432.

1. Identify the depth of the water on Monday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday.
3. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the given information.

1. **Depth on Monday:**
   The depth of the water on Monday is given as 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is \( 16 \) feet.

answer:  To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.
2. Subtract the total cost from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the computer and accessories:
- Computer cost: €1090
- Scanner cost: €157
- CD burner cost: €74
- Printer cost: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition:
€1090 + €157 = €1243
€1243 + €74 = €1317
€1317 + €102 = €1423

So, the total cost of the computer and accessories is €1423.

Next, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

answer:  To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs per babysitting}} \approx 5.05 \text{ babysittings} \]

Since Sandra can't babysit a fraction of a time, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs to babysit:
\[ 6 \text{ times} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 6 times to ensure that she has enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

answer:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule into weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the miles Pancho walks on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Pancho walks 20 miles each weekday.
- Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays is \( 5 \times 20 = 100 \) miles.

Next, let's calculate the miles Pancho walks on weekends:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week.
- Pancho walks 10 miles each weekend day.
- Therefore, the total miles walked on weekends is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:
- Total miles walked on weekdays: 100 miles
- Total miles walked on weekends: 20 miles
- Total miles walked in a week: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) miles

So, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week.

answer:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the potential income loss from doing her taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the potential income loss from doing her taxes herself:
- If Jackie does her taxes herself, she loses 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour.
- Therefore, the total income loss is \( 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \).

Next, let's consider the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, let's find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant:
- The potential income loss from doing her taxes herself is $105.
- The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.
- The difference between the potential income loss and the cost of hiring the accountant is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 less than she would if she did her taxes herself.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   - The hat costs $25.

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jacket is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   - The average cost of the hat and the jacket is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   - Add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.
   - Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
   - Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
   - Total cost = $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is \boxed{150}.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = \$0.50 \text{ per glass} \times 20 \text{ glasses} = \$10 \]

Next, determine the total cost to produce one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Since they made a profit of $25, the total cost to produce the gallons of lemonade must be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Profit} = \$10 - \$25 = \$25 \]

To find out how much they spent on lemons, we multiply the total cost per gallon by the number of gallons (which we don't have, but since we are only interested in the cost of lemons, we can directly use the total cost per gallon):
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$5 \]

Therefore, they spent $3 on lemons.

- Student loans: $300/month + 50% of $300/month = $300/month + $150/month = $450/month
- Credit card: $200/month + 50% of $200/month = $200/month + $100/month = $250/month
- Mortgage: $500/month + 50% of $500/month = $500/month + $250/month = $750/month

Next, add the increased monthly payments for all debts to find the total monthly payment:

$450/month + $250/month + $750/month = $1450/month

Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by the number of months in a year to find the total annual payment:

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000 on car fuel.
After these expenses, Zaid has $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500 left.

   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, the number of white carnations is \( \frac{200}{5} = 40 \).

2. **Find the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \).

3. **Determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver:**
   - Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm.
   - Since the problem does not specify the number of red roses that have not been delivered, we assume that Fred must deliver all the ordered red roses to keep Sandra's business.

Therefore, Fred must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm.

**Answer: Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.**

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jan's current age:**
   - Jan is currently 30 years old.

2. **Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years old.

3. **Mark's current age:**
   - Since two years ago, Mark was 20 years old, his current age is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) years old.

4. **Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jean is currently 24 years old.

answer:  To determine the number of votes the loser received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes the winner received.
2. Subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

First, let's calculate the number of votes the winner received:

The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. The total number of students who voted is 80.

\[ \\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 \]

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = 60 \]

Next, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner} \]

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 \]

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 20 \]

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

answer:  To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest and then add it to the original amount.

1. Calculate the monthly interest:
   - The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be written as 0.02 in decimal form.
   - The monthly interest is the principal amount ($100) multiplied by the monthly interest rate (0.02).
   - Monthly interest = $100 * 0.02 = $2

2. Calculate the total interest for 3 months:
   - Total interest = monthly interest multiplied by the number of months (3).
   - Total interest = $2 * 3 = $6

3. Calculate the total amount to be paid:
   - Total amount to be paid = principal amount + total interest
   - Total amount to be paid = $100 + $6 = $106

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months.

1. Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
2. Calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna.
3. Add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total.

Given:
- Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
- Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

First, we calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} + \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

answer:  First, calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
- The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
- There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

Next, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
- The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
- There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.
- The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2.
- The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

Now, compare the probabilities:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50%
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 25%

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than it is he rolls two even numbers in a row.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters and rabbits.

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is 1 pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Total straw for hamsters and rabbits:
\[ 10 \times 5 + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among all rodents is 160. Therefore, the number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is:
\[ 160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Since there are 3 cages with equal groups of rats, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \]

So, Russell has 15 rats.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement.

First, let's find the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- There are 10 ducks.
- Therefore, the total weekly requirement is:
  \[
  3.5 \text{ pounds/du/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
  \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the daily requirement is:
  \[
  \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 5.14 \text{ pounds/day}
  \]

So, a flock of ten ducks needs approximately 5.14 pounds of insects per day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:
\[ \$20.25 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of food, which is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets:
\[ \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides:
\[ 2 \times \$33 = \$66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$20.25 + \$15.75 + \$66 = \$102.00 \]

They agreed to split all the costs evenly, so we divide the total cost by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

Therefore, each friend paid:
\[ \$34.00 \]

So, each of the three friends paid $34.00.

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \$34.00 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader sold as \( x \).

The trader buys each bag for $20 and transports each bag for $2, so the total cost for buying and transporting each bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars per bag} \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ 30x \text{ dollars} \]

The profit made by the trader is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. The total cost for \( x \) bags is:
\[ 22x \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is given as $400, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold **50 bags** of wheat.

Given:
- Cost of a pencil = $1.20
- Cost of an eraser = $0.30

The cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.20 + 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 1.50 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 12.00 \]

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

   - The neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white.
   - One third of 18 flamingos is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos.
   - So, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors put back 6 white flamingos.

3. **Sunday Morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

Now, we need to find how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos.

2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons:

- Violetta needs 5 crayons.
- Each crayon costs $2.

Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 crayons × $2 per crayon
Total cost = $10

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:

- Violetta has $20.
- The total cost of the crayons is $10.

Change = Amount of money - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 in change.

1. **Initial Number of Trees:**
   Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net Change per Year:**
   - Tom plants 10 trees per year.
   - Tom chops down 2 trees per year.
   - Net change per year = 10 trees planted - 2 trees chopped down = 8 trees per year.

3. **After 10 Years:**
   - Net change over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
   - Total trees after 10 years = 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees.

4. **Trees that Die:**
   - 30% of the trees die.
   - Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

5. **Final Number of Trees:**
   - Trees remaining after some trees die = 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from each publisher:

- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.

Now, calculate the total earnings from each publisher:

- Earnings from Publisher A: \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents
- Earnings from Publisher B: \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents

Finally, add the earnings from both publishers to find Mark's total weekly earnings:

First, let's calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning:
- Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
- Therefore, the morning water intake is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water he gets in the afternoon:
- Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
- Therefore, the afternoon water intake is \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) liters.

Now, we sum the morning and afternoon water intake to find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day:
- Total water intake = Morning water intake + Afternoon water intake
- Total water intake = 25 liters + 30 liters
- Total water intake = 55 liters

So, Baldur gets a total of 55 liters of water every day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first four weeks:

1. He rode his bike 5 times a week.
2. Each ride was 25 kilometers.
3. In one week, he rode 5 * 25 = 250 kilometers.
4. Over four weeks, he rode 250 * 4 = 1000 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the next three weeks:

1. He rode his bike 2 times a week.
2. Each ride was 60 kilometers.
3. In one week, he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
4. Over three weeks, he rode 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Finally, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode:

Total distance = 1000 kilometers (first four weeks) + 360 kilometers (next three weeks) = 1360 kilometers

Therefore, Micheal rode a total of 1360 kilometers.

answer:  To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the total score she needs for all six tests.

The average of six tests is calculated by dividing the total score by 6. Therefore, the total score needed for an average of 93 is:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Next, we sum the scores Brinley has on the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The total score for all six tests will be:
\[ 438 + x \]

We set this equal to 558:
\[ 438 + x = 558 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 558 - 438 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 120 on her sixth test.

answer:  Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens. According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \), and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

The total number of eggs collected each day is given as 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

answer:  To find the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Tuesday is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Wednesday is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add the number of cakes bought each day:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total number of cakes = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes

Thus, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days.

answer:  Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so the total cost of the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and babysits 4 times, so she earns:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

She already has $10 saved, so the total amount she has from babysitting is:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

She needs a total of $70, and she already has $30, so she needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times more to afford the jacket and shoes.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates cost:
\[ 6000 \times 6 = 36000 \]

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Since one dozen is 12 cups, twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 24 \times 12 = 288 \text{ cups} \]

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{288} \approx 120.02 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is approximately $120.02.

answer:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.5 \]

Since Lori can't work a fraction of an hour, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need to work 45 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

So, Lori will have to work 45 hours.

answer:  To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide that by his walking speed.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 1.5 miles
- Width = 6 miles

So, the perimeter is:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( T \) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]
\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

After 4 minutes, the small pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons, and the big pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

Now, the small pool has \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool has \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2x = -48 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 24 - 16 = 8 \) gallons of water.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored \( 54 \) points.

2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is \(3 \times 21 = 63\) years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is \(2 \times 21 = 42\) years old.

Next, let's calculate their ages in three years:

- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old

Now, we calculate the average age in three years:

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:
12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000

Next, calculate the tax on the total cost:
240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000

Then, add the tax to the original cost to find the total including tax:
240,000 + 24,000 = $264,000

Now, calculate the total registration cost for all cars:
12 cars * $1,000/car = $12,000

Finally, add the registration cost to the total including tax to find the total amount Mark pays:
264,000 + 12,000 = $276,000

answer:  First, determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can complete the puzzle.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. Therefore, her mom can add:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Together, they can add:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, calculate the total time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The total number of pieces is 360, and they can add 6 pieces per minute. Therefore, the time required is:
\[ \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the time from minutes to hours.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is equal to:
\[ \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

\[\boxed{1 \text{ hour}} \]

answer:  To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices required.
2. Determine how many pizzas are needed to provide that number of slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices required:
- There are 20 friends.
- Each friend will have 4 slices.

\[ \text{Total slices} = 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to provide 80 slices:
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

\[ \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

So, 84 watermelons remain after the first harvest.

Then, calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest two weeks later:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were harvested two weeks later.

Finally, find the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is given as 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial number of pens he buys and the number of new pens he can create from the empty ones.

1. **Initial Pens:**
   Ram starts with 25 pens.

2. **Creating New Pens from Empty Pens:**
   Ram can create one new pen from five empty pens.

3. **Calculating New Pens:**
   Since each new pen requires five empty pens, we can calculate the number of new pens he can create by dividing the total number of empty pens by the number of empty pens required for one new pen:
   \[
   \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{\text{Total empty pens}}{\text{Empty pens per new pen}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5
   \]

4. **Total Number of Pens:**
   To find the total number of pens, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens created:
   \[
   \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30
   \]

Therefore, Ram gets a total of 30 pens.

answer:  First, let's determine how many people Mike is still a pen pal with. He originally had 5 penpals but stopped being penpals with 2 of them:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, Mike is still a pen pal with 3 people.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week. Each person sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long:

\[ 3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike writes in kind, he also writes 30 pages each week.

Now, let's determine how much time Mike spends writing each week. Mike writes one page every 6 minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Mike spends \( 3 \) hours writing each week.

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can calculate James's candies as follows:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We do this by subtracting James's candies from John's candies:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.

If Dolly and Pandora read each other's books in addition to their own, we can calculate the total number of books read as follows:

- Dolly reads her own books.
- Pandora reads her own books.
- They also read each other's books.

So, the total number of books read is:

- Dolly's books: 2
- Pandora's books: 1
- Shared books: 1 (since they read each other's books)

Adding these together gives:

\[ 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 4 books by the end.

4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, so let's call this number \(x\). So, Griffin then had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Therefore, Griffin had \((9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so \(7 + x = 27\).

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Therefore, the number of bananas Jamal has is:

\[ 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:

\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:

answer:  First, let's determine the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard. Since Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has:

\[ \text{Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, let's determine the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:

\[ \text{Number of trees in Harry's yard} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees in Harry's yard} - \text{Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed last night and today, and then sum them up.

Last night:
- Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Rick killed 15 cougars.

Total animals killed last night = 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.

Today:
- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's calculate the number of wolves Rick killed today:
- Rick killed 15 cougars last night.
- Today, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

Next, let's calculate the number of cougars Rick killed today:
- Rick killed 15 cougars last night.
- Today, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Total animals killed today = 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals.

Total animals killed by Rick = 25 animals + 57 animals = 82 animals.

answer:  To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Determine how many times Robert went down the water slide based on Anne's times.

First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, and Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ 4 \times 21 = 84 \text{ times} \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total weight of the 200-foot redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, a 200-foot tree weighs:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \times 400 \text{ pounds/foot} = 80,000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's weight:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 80,000 \text{ pounds} = 0.30 \times 80,000 \text{ pounds} = 24,000 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original weight:

answer:  To find out how much Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Pennies:
   - 100 pennies * $0.01 per penny = $1.00

2. Nickels:
   - 40 nickels * $0.05 per nickel = $2.00

3. Dimes:
   - 20 dimes * $0.10 per dime = $2.00

4. Dollar bills:
   - 40 dollar bills * $1.00 per dollar bill = $40.00

Now, we add up all the amounts:

$1.00 (penies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $<<1+2+2+40=45.00>>45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to heat up to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil.

So, the time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to heat up the oil and the time to cook the chicken to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:

answer:  To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, let's find two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.

Next, we need to convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
6200 \text{ pennies} \div 100 \text{ pennies/dollar} = 62 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

answer:  To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) windows.

Next, let's add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in one house is \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) windows.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is:
- \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) windows.

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20.

answer:  To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Transfer fees**: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
2. **Brokerage fee**: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
3. **Remaining loan amount**: $250,000

First, let's sum up all the expenses paid:
$12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Now, subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds:

answer:  First, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, calculate the total price of the house:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Finally, determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
Difference = Total price - Budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 per ad * 50 ads = $250

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.
- Total cost for television ads = $75 per ad * 15 ads = $1125

Finally, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, we calculate the total number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the number of stitches required for the sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \), and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

1. Calculate the total cost of the items.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Adding these amounts together:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
- Amount paid: $20.00
- Total cost: $15.00

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $15.00
Change = $5.00

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch per gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads is:
\[ 17 \text{ inches} \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses \boxed{68} sterling silver beads per necklace.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \).
- There are also 3 coaches.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to serve 39 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after accounting for the cards with the letter A:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after accounting for the cards with the letter B:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C:
\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D by subtracting the number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards:
\[ 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards with the letter D is:

answer:  First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]
\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half the number of spots they all have combined:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

answer:  To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the known rows.

The flag has three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

The flag also has two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtracting the stars from the known rows from the total number of stars gives:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each row contains 5 stars, we can find the number of rows of 5 stars by dividing the remaining number of stars by the number of stars per row:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

- Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents.
  \[
  5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Kelly has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents.
  \[
  2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Adding these together:
  \[
  125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents}
  \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount Kelly has:

- The can of pop costs 55 cents.
  \[
  145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents}
  \]

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

answer:  To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
\[ \text{Cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
\[ \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of popsicles} + \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 5 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars consumed by the adults. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, subtract the number of chocolate bars consumed by the adults from the total number of chocolate bars:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

answer:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and it traveled 480 miles. To find the time it took, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Using the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

answer:  To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that together they have 10 times less medals than the total given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 17 medals.
- Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

We know that together they have 10 times less medals than the total given out. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is \( 10 \times 39 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out is 390.

- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the first day:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 activities

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses: 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the second day:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 activities

Total activities over the two days:
170 activities (first day) + 200 activities (second day) = 370 activities

Therefore, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is 370.

answer:  To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight each truck can carry:
\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points each player has after the extra points:

- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Finally, we add up the total points of all three players:

answer:  Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Therefore, she works for 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

She takes 2 pauses, each lasting half an hour, which is 30 minutes. So, the total time for pauses is 2 pauses * 30 minutes/pause = 60 minutes.

The total time she spends working on the online task is 180 minutes - 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 120 minutes, we divide the total working time by the rate at which she earns money:

120 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 12 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:

12 intervals * $5/interval = $60

Therefore, Susan earns $60 for the online task between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.

answer:  To determine by how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold during the week:
- Weekend: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18

Now, let's perform the addition:
20 + 15 = 35
35 + 12 = 47
47 + 18 = 65

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

Next, we compare this to his target of 120 crates:
Target: 120 crates
Crates sold: 65 crates

To find out how many crates Sam was off, we subtract the crates sold from the target:
120 - 65 = 55

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

1. Calculate the number of books she sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books she sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the total earnings from the books sold in the second year.

1. **Number of books sold in the first year:**
   Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold in the current year. Since she sold 45 books in the current year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

answer:  To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \]

There are 5 members in the household, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \times 5 \text{ members} = 2 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we know the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg. To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total weight of the bag by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/week}} = 21 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last the household 21 weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine Joey's weight loss rate. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy loses in one week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, which is 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 0.5 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take her to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight.

answer:  To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.
2. Determine the total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, which is twice the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

First, let's find the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:
- On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
- On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.

Total time on Monday and Sunday = 16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, which is twice the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:
- Total time for Tuesday = 2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

1. Three people eat three eggs each day:
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. The rest of the family (remaining people) eat two eggs each day:
   \[
   2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed in one day:
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[
13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
\]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

6 business suits * $100 per suit = $6000

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 per suitcase = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1250

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$6000 + $150 + $1250 = $7400

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so his total spending will be $7400 + $2000 = $9400.

answer:  To determine the number of new limbs grown after 15 days, we need to consider the growth period for both arms and legs.

1. **Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of 3-day periods is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).
   - Therefore, 15 days will result in 5 extra arms.

2. **Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of 5-day periods is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).
   - Therefore, 15 days will result in 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs grown, we add the number of extra arms and legs:

\[ 5 \text{ extra arms} + 3 \text{ extra legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs} \]

So, after 15 days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

answer:  Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Given that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{6D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 6D = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ D = \frac{210}{6} = 35 \]

Therefore, there are 35 players on the defense.

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people

Total invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:

8 people couldn't come due to illness.
1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments.

First, calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:

1/4 * 8 = 2 people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

8 (illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people

Finally, subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of invited people to find out how many people showed up:

24 (invited) - 10 (couldn't come) = 14 people

Therefore, 14 people showed up for Martha's party.

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Discount per tub: $13 - $11 = $2

Next, let's calculate the discount on a packet of milk:
- Original price of one packet of milk: $0.5
- Discounted price of one packet of milk: $0.5
- Discount per packet: $0.5 - $0.5 = $0

Now, let's calculate the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:
- Savings for 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Savings for 4 packets of milk: 4 packets * $0/packet = $0

Total savings = Savings for 2 tubs of ice cream + Savings for 4 packets of milk
Total savings = $4 + $0 = $4

So, if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, you will save $4 in total.

Therefore, Noah's current age is:

\[ 23 + 6 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. So, the population of Chile six years ago was:

\[ 3000 \times 23 = 69000 \text{ people} \]

Since six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is:

\[ 2 \times 69000 = 138000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the current population of Chile is:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We know the total number of electric wires is 45. Let \( P \) represent the number of electric poles. According to the ratio:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \( P \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
P \times 3 = 1 \times 45
\]

\[
3P = 45
\]

\[
P = \frac{45}{3}
\]

\[
P = 15

answer:  To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool:
- The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.
- The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
  \[
  V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
  \]
- Substituting the given dimensions:
  \[
  V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet}
  \]

Next, we calculate the cost to fill the pool:
- The cost per cubic foot is $0.1.
- Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
  \[
  C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is 12 dollars.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Adding these to the 20 marbles he bought from Johanna:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Now, Solomon has 28 marbles.

Next, we add these to the originally 50 marbles in the store:

So, Solomon now has 78 marbles in the store.

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

answer:  To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream).

1. **Cooling effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - Number of ice cubes used = 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes.

2. **Weakening effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Total weakening effect from ice cubes = 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters.

3. **Weakening effect from cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - Total weakening effect = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker than the original brew.

1. Calculate the rewards earned.
2. Subtract the rewards from the total purchase.
3. Apply the coupon discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned.**

The customer spent $43 and earns $1 for every $20 spent.

answer:  For Job A:
1. Annual income before taxes: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
3. Net income after taxes: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
1. Annual income before taxes: $42,000
2. Property tax: $6,000
3. Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
5. Net income after taxes: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net income between Job B and Job A is:

answer:  Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as \( x \).

Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record. Therefore, each person receives \( \frac{x}{2} \) new records.

Since there are 5 people, the total number of new records they receive is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \]

We know that the total number of new records they leave with is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 5x = 14 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 2.8 \]

So, each person brought in 2.8 old records. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records they brought in is:
\[ 5 \times 2.8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records in total.

DJ has 8 guns.
Nick has 10 guns.
RJ has 1 gun.
Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, the total number of paintball guns is 24.

Next, we need to determine how many guns each person would get if they share them equally. There are 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ).

To find out how many guns each person gets, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, each person would have 6 paintball guns.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

answer:  To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone, we need to calculate the time required to increase the charge from 60% to 100%.

1. Calculate the percentage increase needed:
   \[
   100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]

2. Determine the rate of charging:
   The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes.

3. Calculate the time required to increase 40% charge:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{40\%}{1\% \text{ per 3 minutes}} = \frac{40}{3} \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. Convert the time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{\frac{40}{3} \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = \frac{40}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take 1/3 hours to fully charge the phone.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \). According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \) legs.
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) legs.

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 \text{ (cow legs)} + 80 \text{ (chicken legs)} = 160 \]

Therefore, the animals have a total of 160 legs altogether.

answer:  First, let's determine the weight of each animal based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds + 20 pounds
Total weight = 260 pounds

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs:
- There are 40 tables with 4 legs each.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for these tables is \( 40 \times 4 = 160 \) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
- There are 50 tables with 3 legs each.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for these tables is \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) legs.

Finally, we add the number of legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
- Total number of legs = Legs from tables with 4 legs + Legs from tables with 3 legs
- Total number of legs = 160 + 150
- Total number of legs = 310

Thus, the restaurant's tables have a total of 310 legs.

answer:  To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased distance Tyson needs to run each day based on his coach's advice.
2. Multiply the increased daily distance by the number of days in June to get the total distance.

First, let's calculate the increased distance:
- Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day.
- His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more.
- Therefore, the additional distance is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- So, the increased daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, let's calculate the total distance for June:
- June has 30 days.
- Tyson runs 6000 meters each day.
- Therefore, the total distance covered in June is \( 6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \) meters.

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is \( 180,000 \) meters.

1. Calculate the number of balls Josh is juggling at the end of the fourth week.
2. Account for the balls that were dropped during the performance.
3. Adjust for the balls that were caught and what was lost.

First, let's calculate the number of balls Josh is juggling at the end of the fourth week:
- Josh starts with 3 balls.
- He adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks.
- Therefore, at the end of the fourth week, he is juggling \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

Next, we account for the balls that were dropped during the performance:
- Josh drops 3 balls.
- 2 of the dropped balls are caught, and 1 is lost.
- Therefore, the number of balls lost is \(3 - 2 = 1\).

Now, we adjust the number of balls he was juggling before the performance:
- He was juggling 7 balls.
- He loses 1 ball.

Thus, Josh starts juggling on stage with \(7 - 1 = 6\) balls.

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A.
- Therefore, Juice Box B costs \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of Juice Box C:
- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A.
- Therefore, Juice Box C costs \(4 + 7 = 11\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the costs of Juice Box C and Juice Box B:
- Juice Box C costs $11.
- Juice Box B costs $9.
- The difference is \(11 - 9 = 2\) dollars.

Therefore, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Marisa spends each day on lollipops. She buys 4 lollipops, and each lollipop costs 25 cents.

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa saves each day. She receives $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops.

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much money Marisa saves over 5 days. If she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank over the course of 5 days.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. Therefore, his total change is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Billy started with $10 and has $4 in change, the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

answer:  First, calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors} \times \$100 \text{ per tractor} = \$1000 \]

Next, calculate the daily revenue from silos:
\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos} \times \$220 \text{ per silo} = \$1100 \]

Now, find the increase in daily revenue:
\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

Finally, calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Daily revenue from tractors}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one round trip:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city to the first city: (75 + 100) - 50 = 125 - 50 = 75 miles

So, the total distance for one round trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 75 = 250 \text{ miles} \]

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 250 \times 3 = 750 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total service distance by the distance traveled in one day:
\[ \frac{18000}{750} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes 24 days between services.

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, and this is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
   \[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, they sold \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the amount of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, they sold \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.
   - However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Now, we sum up the number of pairs sold each day:

\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

- Each pair consists of 2 socks.
- Therefore, the number of socks from the pairs is:
  \[
  10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}

answer:  Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each person has:

- Axel's total pesos: \( 50 \text{ silver pesos} + 80 \text{ gold pesos} = 130 \text{ pesos} \)
- Anna's total pesos: \( 100 \text{ silver pesos} + 120 \text{ gold pesos} = 220 \text{ pesos} \)

The total number of pesos they have together is:
\[ 130 \text{ pesos} + 220 \text{ pesos} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

answer:  Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue from selling all the lemonade is 36 * $1 = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total expenses from her total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
Profit = $36 - $18
Profit = $18

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. Since she sells 36 cups in total, we need to determine how many hours she is open to sell the lemonade:

Total Hours = Total Cups / Cups per Hour
Total Hours = 36 / 4
Total Hours = 9

To find her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the total number of hours:

Profit per Hour = Total Profit / Total Hours
Profit per Hour = $18 / 9
Profit per Hour = $2

Therefore, Millie will make a profit per hour of $2.

answer:  To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

First, let's add up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Now, let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the test scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

Since Wilson needs a grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend, and his current grade is exactly 80, he meets the requirement for the car.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the members are boys and 50% are girls:

- Number of boys = 52 * 0.50 = 26
- Number of girls = 52 * 0.50 = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of girls performing is:

- Number of girls performing = 26

On the day of the performance, half of the girls performing can't make it to the show:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Total number of people singing = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, 16 people sang in the performance. #### 16

answer:  To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- There are 6 erasers.
- Total cost of erasers = 6 erasers * $2 per eraser = $<<6*2=12>>12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- There are 8 pencils.
- Total cost of pencils = 8 pencils * $3 per pencil = $<<8*3=24>>24.

Finally, we add the total cost of the erasers and the total cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- Total cost of erasers = $12
- Total cost of pencils = $24
- Total cost = $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36.

Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

1. Calculate the total interest over five months.
2. Add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid.
3. Divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total interest over five months. The interest rate is 10%, so the interest for five months is:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Next, add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Finally, divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \). According to the ratio given, the number of popsicles Sam has is 6 times the number of popsicles Betty has.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting \( S = 6B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ B + 6B = 165 \]
\[ 7B = 165 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{165}{7} = 25 \]

So, Betty has 25 popsicles. Now, let's find out how many popsicles Sam has:
\[ S = 6B = 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Sam has 150 popsicles. The difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty is:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket.
- Therefore, cost per ride = 2 tickets * $2/ticket = $4 per ride.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha = 9 rides * $4/ride = $36.

Next, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Therefore, the cost per ride with the bracelet is $30 / 9 rides = $3/ride.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for David = 9 rides * $3/ride = $27.

Now, let's find out how much David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying ride tickets:
- The cost for David if he buys tickets is $36.
- The cost for David if he buys the bracelet is $27.
- The savings for David = $36 - $27 = $9.

answer:  Let \( x \) be the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

After selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he had 12.8 hectares left. This means the remaining \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's calculate it:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

1. **Spiders:**
   - Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Millipedes:**
   - Nancy saw \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many millipedes as spiders.
   - Number of millipedes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).

3. **Stink bugs:**
   - The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   - Number of stink bugs = \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, we sum up all the bugs:
- Number of spiders = 90
- Number of millipedes = 30
- Number of stink bugs = 48

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

answer:  Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs twice the amount of flour and milk of a normal recipe.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups of flour
- Quadruple batch: 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups of flour
- Each bag of flour is 2 cups, so Mark needs 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup of milk
- Quadruple batch: 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups of milk
- Each bottle of milk is 2 cups, so Mark needs 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- Number of bags of flour: 6

answer:  Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts per day.
If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day.
The new energy usage per day will be 900 watts * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts per day.
The difference in energy usage per day is 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts per day.
Over 30 days, he will save 4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135,000 watts.
To convert watts to kilowatts, we divide by 1000: 135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.

   - The builder gets paid $50 every day.

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the year:**
   - Multiply the number of days worked in a year by the earnings per day.
   - Total earnings = \( 288 \times 50 = 14400 \) dollars.

So, the builder earns $14,400 if he works for a year.

answer:  Elliott completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps.

He also took another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.

So, the total steps he has taken so far is \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \) steps.

After his jog, he still has 2,000 steps left to take.

Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is \( 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 \) steps.

Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

answer:  First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's subtract the number of slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, Jenny eats 2 slices:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, there are 3 slices left.

answer:  Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy at a price of $3 per pound, so she spent 2 * $3 = $6 on taffy.
She also bought 1 pound of taffy at half the price, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per pound, so she spent 1 * $1.50 = $1.50 on taffy.
In total, she spent $6 + $1.50 = $7.50 on taffy.
She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so she spent 4 * $0.25 = $1.00 on magnets.
In total, she spent $7.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $9.00.
Sally started with $10 and spent $9.00, so she has $10 - $9.00 = $1.00 left.

answer:  Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so each sandwich requires 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of cheese. 
To serve 20 people, Tyson will need 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.
Therefore, he will need 5 sandwiches * 2 pounds of meat per sandwich = 10 pounds of meat.
He will also need 5 sandwiches * 2 pounds of cheese per sandwich = 10 pounds of cheese.
The cost of the meat is 10 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $70.00.
The cost of the cheese is 10 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $30.00.
The total cost for the meat and cheese is $70.00 + $30.00 = $100.00.

answer:  To determine the total number of calories John consumed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk John drinks.
2. Determine the calories per ounce of milk.
3. Multiply the total amount of milk by the calories per ounce.

First, let's calculate the total amount of milk John drinks:
- Each glass of milk is 8 ounces.
- John drinks 2 glasses of milk.

\[
\text{Total amount of milk} = 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce.

\[
\text{Calories per ounce} = 3 \text{ calories/ounce}
\]

Now, we multiply the total amount of milk by the calories per ounce:

\[
\text{Total calories} = 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories}
\]

Therefore, John consumed a total of 48 calories.

\[
\boxed{48}

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:

- The first package is worth $400.
- The second package is worth twice as much as the first, so it is \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \).
- The total cost before discount is \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \).

Next, we apply the 20% discount:

- The discount amount is \( 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \).
- The total cost after the discount is \( 1200 - 240 = 960 \).

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework:

- The finale firework costs $150.
- The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted cost of the packages and the cost of the finale firework: \( 960 + 150 = 1110 \).

So, the total amount Tim spent is \( 1110 \) dollars.

answer:  To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount amount per blouse.
2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

First, let's find the discount amount per blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse:

\[ \text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, we multiply the discounted price per blouse by the number of blouses to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

The answer is $56.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes across all zebras.
2. Divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras.

First, let's calculate the total number of stripes:

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \( 36 \) stripes
- Another zebra with half as many stripes as 36: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes

Now, add these together:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, count the total number of zebras:
\[ 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \]

Finally, divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
\[ \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, the size of Zack's locker is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}

answer:  In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. Therefore, each employee receives $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600 per week.
The total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $600/employee/week = $24,000 per week.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees lost their contracts.
The number of employees remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.
The company continues to pay 30 employees the same amount as in May, which is $600 per employee per week.
The total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $600/employee/week = $18,000 per week.
Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $24,000 (May) + $18,000 (June) = $42,000 in total.

answer:  Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees. She also gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500

Simplifying the equation:

150 + x = 500

Subtracting 150 from both sides:

x = 500 - 150

x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The answer is 350.

Next, we calculate the time it will take Toby to read the book:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to get to the airport:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he will spend at the airport from the time he needs to be there:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

2. Calculate the number of candles that have the wet dog smell among those that are likely to explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that are likely to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are likely to explode.

\[ \text{Number of candles likely to explode} = 50000 \times 0.01 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these candles also have the wet dog smell. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, 5% of the 500 candles that are likely to explode will have the wet dog smell.

\[ \text{Number of candles with wet dog smell} = 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \]

2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 304 = D \]
\[ 56 = D \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( D = 56 \).

Therefore, there are 56 dromaries in the herd.

Each feeder built by Lillian attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each built feeder attracts:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds} \]

Since there are 3 built feeders, the total number of birds from the built feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the birds from the store-bought feeders and the built feeders:
\[ 60 + 90 = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day if the same number keeps coming to her bird feeders.

answer:  To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money the second company gave Mr. Josue.
2. Add the amounts received from both banks.
3. Add the total amount received to the initial capital Mr. Josue had.

First, let's calculate the amount of money the second company gave Mr. Josue. The second company gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second company gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Finally, we add the total amount received to the initial capital Mr. Josue had. He initially had $5000 in capital, so his total capital now is:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total of $17000 in capital.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money George has left after buying the chips. He had 1% of his money left, which is equivalent to 1% of 500 cents:

\[ 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

So, he had 5 cents left after buying the chips.

Now, let's find out how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent 120 cents on chips and had 5 cents left:

\[ 120 + 5 = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find the number of candy bars George bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost per candy bar:

\[ 375 \div 75 = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

answer:  To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we add the amount of money Dora has saved and the amount her mother gave her:
- Dora has saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Adding these together gives us the total amount of money Dora has:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items to find out how much more she needs:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Josey used. Since she used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons of gas to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

answer:  The caterer initially prepared hot dogs for 36 guests. Half of the guests would have two hot dogs each, so:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests} \]

Each of these 18 guests would have two hot dogs, so:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs} \]

The caterer initially prepared 36 hot dogs, so the number of hot dogs left overs is:

\[ 80 - 36 = 44 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since each guest would have one additional hot dog, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests} \]

Therefore, 4 additional guests did not get a second hot dog.

answer:  First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to baking:
- Marcus bakes for 3 hours.
- Every hour, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
- Temperature increase = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to opening the window:
- Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
- The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
- Temperature decrease = (30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.

Now, let's find the net temperature change:
- Initial temperature = 40 degrees
- Temperature increase due to baking = 15 degrees
- Temperature decrease due to opening the window = 6 degrees

Net temperature change = 15 degrees - 6 degrees = 9 degrees

Finally, let's calculate the final temperature:
- Initial temperature = 40 degrees
- Net temperature change = 9 degrees

Final temperature = 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

For Elizabeth:
- She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads for Elizabeth = (1 pack * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs * 20 beads/pack) = 20 beads + 40 beads = 60 beads.

For Margareth:
- She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.
- Total beads for Margareth = (3 packs * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs * 20 beads/pack) = 60 beads + 80 beads = 140 beads.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between Elizabeth and Margareth:
- Difference = Total beads for Margareth - Total beads for Elizabeth
- Difference = 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads.

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have taken 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes
- Bike: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes
- Run: Let's denote the time James took for the run as x minutes.

Total time for James = 36 + 85 + x = 160

Solving for x:
x = 160 - 121
x = 39

Therefore, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run.

answer:  To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards.

First, convert the length from yards to feet:
3 yards = 3 * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Next, use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width:
Area = Length * Width
360 square feet = 9 feet * Width

Solve for the width:
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Substitute the length and width:
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

- 30 minutes is equivalent to 30/60 = 0.5 hours.
- Distance = Speed * Time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Next, we calculate the number of bails of hay needed for 16 miles.

- The horse eats 1/2 bail of hay per mile.
- Number of bails needed = 16 miles * (1/2) bails/mile = 8 bails.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay.

- Each bail of hay costs $3.
- Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

Finally, we find the change he has after buying the hay.

- Change = Total money Michael has - Total cost of the hay
- Change = $30 - $24 = $6

answer:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

When you buy the super ticket for $20, the total cost is $19 (since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket). Therefore, the equation for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 19 \]
This confirms that the super ticket option costs $19.

Now, let's consider the regular ticket option. The movie ticket costs $12, and you need to buy one popcorn and one soda at the regular price. The soda costs $3, so the total cost for the regular ticket option is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the regular ticket option must cost $19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

Solving for \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

Next, we find the total number of apples both people eat in one day by multiplying the number of apples each person eats by 2:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of apples both people eat in 30 days by multiplying the number of apples they eat in one day by 30:
\[ 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

The answer is \( \boxed{240} \).

answer:  To determine how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost per balloon.
2. Determine the new cost per balloon after the increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the original cost per balloon:
- Total cost to fill 20 balloons = $900
- Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20 = $45

Next, let's find the new cost per balloon after the increase:
- Increase in cost per balloon = $20
- New cost per balloon = $45 + $20 = $65

Now, let's calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:
- Total cost for 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
- Total cost for 170 balloons = $65 * 170 = $10950

Therefore, Bentley paid $10950 to fill 170 balloons.

answer:  To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the initial cost of the case.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday:
\[ 17 \text{ sneakers} \times \$20 \text{ per shoe} = \$340 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold to the department store:
\[ 48 \text{ sneakers} - 17 \text{ sneakers} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]
\[ 31 \text{ sneakers} \times \$25 \text{ per shoe} = \$775 \]

Now, let's add the revenues from both sales to find the total revenue:
\[ \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, we subtract the initial cost of the case from the total revenue to find the profit:
\[ \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots. The formula for percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

answer:  First, calculate the total distance traveled during each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

- For the second segment at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Next, add the distances from both segments to find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Now, calculate the total time taken for the trip:
- Time for the first segment: 2 hours
- Time for the second segment: 1 hour

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:

Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2.00 trips

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to transport all the feed.

The farmer will need 3 trips.

1. **Red Cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Sum of red and green cards = \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
   - Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is \(\boxed{78}\).

answer:  To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plants Toni has.
2. Determine the number of plants Shondra has based on the information given.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + (0.60 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 90 cents
90 cents = $0.90

Next, subtract the $1 discount Becky received:
$0.90 - $1 = -$0.10
Since the total cost is negative, it means Becky received $0.10 in discount.

Now, calculate the total cost for Kelly's apples before the discount:
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 100 cents
100 cents = $1.00

Next, calculate the 10 percent discount Kelly received:
$1.00 * 0.10 = $0.10
Subtract the discount from the original price:
$1.00 - $0.10 = $0.90

Finally, find how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
$0.90 - (-$0.10) = $0.90 + $0.10 = $1.00

Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles.
2. Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:

- Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth 2 cents.
  - Earnings from aluminum cans each week = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

- Grayson recycles 5 plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
  - Earnings from plastic bottles each week = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:

- Total earnings for a four-week month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling plastic bottles in a four-week month.

answer:  Let \( T \) be the total number of students at the grade level.

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students with a desktop computer is \( \frac{3}{4}T \).

We are also given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students without a desktop computer is 20.

The total number of students \( T \) is the sum of the students with a desktop computer and the students without a desktop computer:
\[ T = \frac{3}{4}T + 20 \]

To solve for \( T \), we first isolate \( T \) on one side of the equation:
\[ T - \frac{3}{4}T = 20 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4}T = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ T = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ T = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the remoras to the same unit as the shark's body length. Since the shark is 10 feet long, we will convert the length of the remoras to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches
So, 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches

Next, we calculate the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras.

Combined length of the remoras = 2 * 6 = 12 inches

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.

Percentage = (Combined length of the remoras / Total length of the shark) * 100
Percentage = (12 / 120) * 100
Percentage = 0.10 * 100
Percentage = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

answer:  To determine how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal of $200, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they have already earned.
2. Subtract the total amount earned from their goal to find out how much more they need.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they have earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tasha's earnings: $91

Total earnings = Keegan's earnings + Tasha's earnings
Total earnings = $83 + $91
Total earnings = $174

Next, we subtract the total amount earned from their goal to find out how much more they need:

Goal: $200
Total earnings: $174

Amount needed = Goal - Total earnings
Amount needed = $200 - $174
Amount needed = $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn $26 more to reach their goal of $200.

answer:  To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk.
2. Divide the total time required to break in the shoes by the total number of days.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk:
- Jason wants to try out in three weeks.
- He can walk 4 days a week.

So, the total number of days he has to walk is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we divide the total time required to break in the shoes by the total number of days:
- It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in the shoes.
- He has 12 days to walk.

So, the time he has to spend walking each day is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking the new shoes each day.

answer:  Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat as \( x \).

According to his dad's rule, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Therefore, the total number of cookies Matt can have is:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 3 \cdot 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to meet his goal of eating 5 cookies.

answer:  To determine how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- \( D \) is the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) is the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( A \) is the set of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Given:
- \( |D| = 9 \)
- \( |P| = 6 \)
- \( |A| = 3 \)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |A| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, 20 kids aren't allergic to dairy or peanuts.

answer:  To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
2. Convert the total distance from miles to hours.

First, let's calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
- He runs 12 miles a day.
- He runs 5 days a week.

So, the total distance in a week is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total distance from miles to hours. We know that James runs 10 miles per hour. Therefore, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, James runs for 6 hours a week.

The answer is \( \boxed{6} \).

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{20}{4}
\]

\[

2. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.
   - The normal price per day is $1500.
   - The increased price per day is: $1500 + (0.20 * $1500) = $1800.
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel stay is: 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Given:
- The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.
- The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

First, calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny} \]
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, add the weight of the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is \( \boxed{84} \).

1. **Blue Paint:**
   - Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.
   - Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   - Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.
   - Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total number of tubes:

\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = \text{Blue paint} + \text{Yellow paint} \]
\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = 2 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = 11 \]

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, Luri has:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Each player can store up to 100 songs. So, the number of songs Gabriel can add to his player is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

The number of songs Luri can add to his player is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

answer:  To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walks in 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of minutes Charisma walks in one hour.
2. Calculate the number of minutes Charisma walks in one day.
3. Calculate the number of minutes Charisma walks in 5 days.

First, we know that Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of minutes she walks in one hour as follows:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks in one day. Since she works 8 hours every day:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks in 5 days:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes.

answer:  To determine the total cost of buying snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the snowshoes.

1. Each dog has 4 legs, and there are 6 dogs:
   \[
   4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. Since each pair of snowshoes is needed for 2 legs:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00:
   \[
   12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12 \text{ per pair} = \$144
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all his 6 sled dogs is $144.

answer:  Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \).

According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by all three is 43, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, which is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in one day:
- Morning rides: 2
- Afternoon rides: 2
- Total rides per day: 2 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 4 rides

Next, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days: 4 rides/day * 14 days = 56 rides

Now, calculate the cost of each type of ride:
- Morning ride cost: $6
- Afternoon ride cost: $2

Calculate the total cost for each type of ride:
- Total cost for morning rides: 56 rides * $6/ride = $336
- Total cost for afternoon rides: 56 rides * $2/ride = $112

Finally, calculate the total cost for all rides:
- Total cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $336 + $112 = $448

Therefore, Paul spent $448 on driving his car during these 14 days.

answer:  Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person.
- The food is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25x \).

To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the total costs equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10 guests.

answer:  Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th. Today is December 31st, so he has December 31st total from December 31st to July 19th. 

First, let's calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days.
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.

Adding these up: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 181 days.

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories to lose 30 pounds.

To reach his goal, Andy needs to burn 105,000 calories / 181 days = 5590 calories per day.

answer:  To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to calculate the yards of yarn each of them used and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the yards of yarn Mariah used:
- Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
- There are 364 yards in a skein.
- Therefore, Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards.

Next, let's calculate the yards of yarn her grandma used:
- Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.
- There are 364 yards in a skein.
- Therefore, her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
- Total yards used = Mariah's yards + Grandma's yards
- Total yards used = 91 + 182 = 273 yards

So, they used a total of 273 yards of yarn.

answer:  To determine the length of the couch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the width of the rug.
2. Use the width of the rug to find the length of the couch.

**Step 1: Find the width of the rug.**

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. The chair is 3 feet wide.

\[
\text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \text{ feet} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Find the length of the couch.**

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.

\[
\text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \) dollars.

Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \) dollars.

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2.

The cost of each pack of green apple gum is half the cost of a pack of strawberry gum, so it costs \( \frac{S}{2} \) dollars.

The total cost for all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2S + 2 + \frac{S}{2} = 7 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 2S + \frac{S}{2} + 2 = 7 \]
\[ \frac{5S}{2} + 2 = 7 \]
\[ \frac{5S}{2} = 7 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{5S}{2} = 5 \]
\[ 5S = 10 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ 3L = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost is $90,000.

Each bus trip costs $2.20:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \]

Next, let's consider the cost of the weekly bus pass:
\[ \$20.00 \]

To find out how much she would save, subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save \$2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals on the farm and zoo combined, we need to calculate the number of cows and sheep for each location and then sum them up.

First, let's find the number of cows at the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
- Therefore, the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.

Next, let's find the number of sheep on the farm:
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
- Therefore, the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm and zoo combined is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the answer is 120 animals.

answer:  To determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for both the 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

1. **Cost per stick for 2 x 4 wood:**
   - You get 200 sticks
   - Cost = $4
   - Cost per stick = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

2. **Cost per stick for 2 x 8 wood:**
   - You get 400 sticks
   - Cost = $6
   - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest option, he should choose the 2 x 4 piece of wood because it is less expensive per stick.

3. **Total popsicle sticks he can make with $24:**
   - If he buys the 2 x 4 wood, he will spend $24.
   - With $24, he can make $24 / $0.02 per stick = 1200 sticks.

answer:  Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following equations:

\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

From these equations, we can solve for \( O \) and \( P \):

\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ O = 3 \]

\[ 4P = 4 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ P = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes:

\[ \text{Total} = O + P = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market.

answer:  To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to sum up the hours spent each week.

1. For the first 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours each week:
   \[
   6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For the next 2 weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week:
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. For the last week, Josh spent 6 hours:
   \[
   1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we add up all these hours:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Josh spent a total of 40 hours working out across the 8 weeks.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein (per pair) * 2 pairs = 2 skeins
- Socks: 2 skeins (per pair) * 2 pairs = 4 skeins

Adding these together:
\[ 2 \text{ skeins} + 4 \text{ skeins} + 12 \text{ skeins} + 2 \text{ skeins} + 4 \text{ skeins} = 24 \text{ skeins} \]

Since Martha is making winter wear for all 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins for one grandchild by 3:
\[ 24 \text{ skeins/grandchild} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren} = 72 \text{ skeins} \]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 72 skeins of wool.

The final answer is:
\[ 72 \text{ skeins} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of problems Chris completes on Monday and Tuesday.

- On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.
- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.

Next, we calculate the total number of problems completed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]

Chris started with 100 problems. After completing 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday, the number of remaining problems is:
\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. To find out how many problems he completes on Wednesday, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

So, Chris completes 13 problems on Wednesday.

Finally, we subtract the number of problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, Chris has \(39\) math problems left to complete on Thursday.

answer:  If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 5 days * 2 = 10 days.
If 5 people are working together, they would paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 people = 2 days.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days would be 2 * 24 hours = 48 hours.
Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

answer:  To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for both the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson bought 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for red tulips = 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson bought 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for blue tulips = 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to get the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 rows (red tulips) + 3 rows (blue tulips) = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seashells the girls brought. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. The boys brought 600 seashells, so:

\[ 4 \times 600 = 2400 \]

Adding this to the number of seashells brought by the boys:

\[ 600 + 2400 = 3000 \]

So, the girls brought a total of 3000 seashells. Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls:

\[ 3000 \div 10 = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:**
   - 48 passengers.

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers get off the bus as the number who got off, so \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers get on.
   - Total number of passengers after the first stop: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 80\) passengers.

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than who got off, so \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) passengers get on.
   - Total number of passengers after the second stop: \(80 - 21 + 7 = 66\) passengers.

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs Jenna has. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 20 sofas and 66 chairs:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 20 = 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is:

answer:  To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine the total amount of raisins available for the cookies. Since she is dividing the bag of raisins equally among cookies, granola, and snack mix, each part will have:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

So, each part (9 cups) will be used for the oatmeal cookies.

Next, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed per batch:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ batches} \]

Simplifying the multiplication:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.333 = 4 \text{ batches} \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has now is \( G - 5 \). We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick originally had:

\[ 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

- Peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50

Now, add these amounts together to find the total cost:

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $<<4.50+4.00+4.50=13.00>>13.00

Verna gave $20, so we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old James's cousin will be in 8 years. Let \( C \) represent James's cousin's current age. In 8 years, James's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James's age. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ C + 8 = 2 \times 27 - 5 \]

Calculate the right side of the equation:

\[ C + 8 = 54 - 5 \]
\[ C + 8 = 49 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 49 - 8 \]
\[ C = 41 \]

So, James's cousin is currently 41 years old.

Finally, we calculate the age difference between James and his cousin:

answer:  To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount Tom paid to find the remaining money Tom could have spent on CDs.
3. Calculate how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.

Let's assume the cost of the headphone set is \( H \).

Given:
- Total amount paid: $48
- Cost of one CD: $4

We can set up the equation:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Now, subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount paid:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

Tom has $4 left after buying the headphone set. Since one CD costs $4, with $4, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's total earnings = $16
- Jenny's total earnings = $10
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $<<16-10=6>>6.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \( 2 \times 31 = 62 \) mm thick.

Now, we add up the thicknesses of all four books:

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

answer:  When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day:
- Twice as long as it takes to swim a mile on a cold day is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a warm day:
- On a cold day, it takes \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- On a warm day, it takes \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a warm day and a cold day is:
- \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a warm day than a cold day.

answer:  To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to account for the weight he lost over the 3 months. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, his total weight loss is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Mark's final weight is 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the total weight loss to his final weight:

\[ 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

answer:  To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to determine the total amount he needs to save in the second half of the month.

April has 30 days, so the second half of April has 15 days.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half. Let \( x \) be the amount he saves each day in the first half. Therefore, in the second half, he will save \( 2x \) each day.

The total amount he needs to save in the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Since his total monthly target is $1125, we can set up the equation:

\[ 30x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1125}{30} = 37.5 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $37.50 each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly target.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- Five hamburgers at $4 each: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: \( 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \)
- Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \)

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

\[ 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \]

Carly gives one fifty-dollar bill, which is $50. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

So, Carly gets $17 in change.

Therefore, the answer is $17.

1. Find the size of Zack's locker.
2. Calculate the size of Peter's locker based on Zack's locker.

First, let's find the size of Zack's locker:
- Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Therefore, the size of Zack's locker is half of 24 cubic inches.

\[ \text{Size of Zack's locker} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, let's find the size of Peter's locker:
- Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker.
- Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 12 cubic inches.

\[ \text{Size of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, the size of Peter's locker is \( \boxed{3} \) cubic inches.

answer:  To calculate Antonella's commission, we need to break down the earnings into two parts: the commission on the first $1000 in sales and the commission on the remaining sales over $1000.

1. Commission on the first $1000 in sales:
   - Commission rate: 30%
   - Commission on the first $1000: $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. Commission on the remaining sales over $1000:
   - Total sales: $2500
   - Sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Commission on the remaining sales: $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, add the two amounts together to get the total commission:
- Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission if she sold goods worth $2500.

answer:  To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Calculate the distance he walks in one week.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.**

Jeff's work is 3 miles away, and he walks there and back each day. Therefore, the distance he walks in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance he walks in one week.**

Jeff works 5 days a week. Therefore, the distance he walks in one week is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

answer:  To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then use that to find out how many weeks it will take to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate John's weekly earnings:
- John earns $2 per hour.
- He works 5 hours a day.
- He works 4 days a week.

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for him to save $80. We do this by dividing his savings goal by his weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} \]
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, John will need 2 weeks to save $80.

answer:  To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Given:
- The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
- The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

First, calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} \]
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

answer:  Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( N \).

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old} \]

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

answer:  First, we need to determine the daily recommended amount of coffee. Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is \( R \) cups. According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of the recommended amount, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

If the daily recommended amount of coffee is \( R \) cups, then Juan drinks \( 5R \) cups.

Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the new intake.

Juan's current intake is \( 5R \) cups, and his new intake is 4 cups.

The reduction needed in his daily coffee intake is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended amount of coffee, the reduction needed is \( 5R \) cups.

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 5R cups.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 * 3 days = $30 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he can buy $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week, Peter has $70 - $30 = $40 left to buy plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 6 wooden action figures + 20 plastic action figures = 26 action figures by the end of the week.

answer:  To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house and then subtract that from Herb's house value.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800
   \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value:
   \[
   \text{Juan's house value} = \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200
   \]

3. Calculate the total value of both houses combined:
   \[
   \text{Total value} = \text{Herb's house value} + \text{Juan's house value} = \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200
   \]

So, the combined value of both houses is $129,200.

answer:  To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the costs of spaying the kitten, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying the kitten costs $200.
2. Leah needs 3 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
   \[
   3 \text{ vaccines} \times \$20 \text{ per vaccine} = \$60
   \]
3. The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12. So, the total cost for the broken vases is:
   \[
   4 \text{ vases} \times \$12 \text{ per vase} = \$48
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\$200 \text{ (spaying)} + \$60 \text{ (vaccines)} + \$48 \text{ (broken vases)} = \$308
\]

So, the total cost of the kitten so far is:

answer:  To determine how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate:
Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. Since there were 12 sandwiches in total, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]
So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate:
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. Since there were 12 sandwiches in total, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]
So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]
So, they ate a total of 7 sandwiches.

Finally, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 sandwiches left.

The answer is 5.

answer:  First, calculate the total calories burned during each activity:

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Next, find the total calories burned during both activities:

- Total calories = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, determine the amount of water needed based on the calories burned:

- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories.

To find out how many 200-calorie segments are in 1600 calories, divide the total calories by 200:

- Number of segments = 1600 calories / 200 calories/segment = 8 segments

Finally, multiply the number of segments by the amount of water needed per segment:

- Total water needed = 8 segments * 100 ml/segment = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

answer:  To determine the correct temperature for the recipe, we first need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. We know that when Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The temperature difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage off can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is off by 4% for any temperature. To find the correct temperature for a recipe that requires 520 degrees, we need to adjust for this 4% error.

First, calculate the error amount:

\[ 520 \times 0.04 = 20.8 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, subtract this error from the required temperature:

\[ 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \text{ degrees} \]

answer:  To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes over 2 years and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount removed over 2 years:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Over 2 years, there are \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.
- Katina removes $100 each month.

So, the total amount removed over 2 years is:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times \$100 \text{ per month} = \$2400 \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the savings account:
- Initial amount: $3000
- Total amount removed: $2400

The remaining amount after 2 years is:
\[ \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts.

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00 \]

Since each box contains 90 contacts, and Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 180 contacts.

Finally, calculate the cost per pair of contacts.

\[ \text{Cost per pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

   - Each bird has 2 legs.
   - There are 10 birds.
   - Total legs for birds = 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = legs from dogs + legs from cats + legs from birds
- Total legs = 20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs
- Total legs = 48 legs

Therefore, the pets in the store have 48 legs in total.

answer:  To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to find the plane's speed.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000}{400} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

1. Each implant has a base price of $2000.
2. One implant has a crown that costs an extra $500.
3. Therefore, the cost for one implant with a crown is $2000 + $500 = $2500.
4. George needs 2 implants, so the total cost for the implants is $2500 * 2 = $5000.
5. George has already put down a deposit of $600.
6. Therefore, the remaining amount George needs to pay is $5000 - $600 = $4400.

Next, we need to determine how many hours George needs to work to earn $4400:

1. George makes $15 per hour.
2. To find the number of hours needed, we divide the total amount needed by his hourly wage: $4400 / $15 = 293 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 293 hours before he has enough money to pay for the dental work.

answer:  To determine the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds.

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- Weight loss from Cheerios: 6.25 pounds
- Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
- Difference in weight: 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds.

answer:  First, let's determine how many rotations the tires will undergo in one year.

Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, so in one year, he drives:
\[ 400 \text{ miles/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 4800 \text{ miles/year} \]

The tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. Therefore, for 4800 miles in one year:
\[ 725 \text{ rotations/mile} \times 4800 \text{ miles} = 112,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Each tire can withstand 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total rotations the tire can withstand by the rotations it undergoes per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{112,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 95 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after approximately 95 years.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in one hour, he makes:
\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour, so:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they made in 12 hours.

Ruiz's total in 12 hours:
\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa's total in 12 hours:
\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:
\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

1. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.
2. The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

Let's calculate the height for each day:

- Day 1: 4 feet
- Day 2: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 3: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 4: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet
- Day 5: 32 feet * 2 = 64 feet
- Day 6: 64 feet * 2 = 128 feet
- Day 7: 128 feet * 2 = 256 feet

On Day 7, the beanstalk is 256 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window at 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 7 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

answer:  To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new weight after a 50% increase.
2. Adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds if it turned too heavy.

First, let's calculate the new weight after a 50% increase:

\[ \text{Original weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } 8 \text{ pounds} = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{New weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, we need to adjust it by subtracting 2 pounds:

\[ \text{Adjusted weight} = 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

answer:  To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the total cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,860.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = $95,860 - $29,100 = $66,760.

Therefore, it costs $66,760 more to repave Lewis' street than to repave Monica's street.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. According to the directions, 2 pumps are needed for 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of pumps is:

\[ 2 \text{ pumps} \times 120 \text{ washings} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, so she will use 240 pumps in total.

Next, we need to find the cost per pump. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

\[ \frac{24.00}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert $0.10 to cents:

\[ 0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 10 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

answer:  Let the smallest angle in the triangle be \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

Now, we can find the measures of the other angles:
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is the third angle, which is 90 degrees.

answer:  To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends over the three days and then subtract that from his original amount.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday:
   \[

Now, we add up the amounts spent over the three days:
\[
8 \text{ (Monday)} + 16 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 64 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount he has left is:
\[

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water for the year.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used per week:
- Gary does laundry twice a week.
- Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- Therefore, the total water used per week = 2 loads/week * 20 gallons/load = 40 gallons/week

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Therefore, the total water used per year = 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the water for the year:
- Each gallon of water costs $0.15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the year = 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year

answer:  John received initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
His research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it took 10 * 5 = 50 months.
After the first 5 months, the funding required increased by 50% per month, so the new monthly funding is $100,000 + ($100,000 * 0.5) = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.
For the remaining 45 months, the total funding is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.
Adding the initial funding for the first 5 months to the funding for the remaining 45 months, the total cost is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.
Therefore, John's research cost him $6,850,000.

- Second player's beef tips: 8 ounces
- Third player's steak: 16 ounces
- Fourth player's vegetarian meal: 0 ounces

   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. After the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. Therefore, the height after the third week is:
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

answer:  To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes (kb) per second to megabytes (Mb) per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert kilobytes (kb) to megabytes (Mb).
2. Convert seconds to hours.

First, we need to convert 20 kb per second to Mb per second. We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb.

\[ 20 \text{ kb/second} \times \frac{1 \text{ Mb}}{1000 \text{ kb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \]

Next, we need to convert Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour.

\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 7.2 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

So, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 7.2 Mb per hour.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{7.2 \text{ Mb/hour}} \]

answer:  To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Calculate the number of men who can stay upright.

First, let's find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright and there are 100 riders:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]
So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women:
\[ 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]
So, 15 women can stay upright.

Finally, to find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]
So, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

answer:  To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. **First DVD:**
   - Total play time: 1000 times
   - Plays already made: 356 times
   - Remaining play time: 1000 - 356 = 644 times

2. **Second DVD:**
   - Total play time: 1000 times
   - Plays already made: 135 times
   - Remaining play time: 1000 - 135 = 865 times

Now, we add the remaining play times for both DVDs:
- Remaining play time of the first DVD: 644 times
- Remaining play time of the second DVD: 865 times

Total remaining play time = 644 + 865 = 1509 times

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, calculate the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days. Since the truck towed four fewer cars each day than the first three days, it towed:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed in the week:

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to sell 750kg of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.

So, the total amount of meat sold in one day is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount of meat sold in one day:
\[ 750 \text{ kg} \div 150 \text{ kg/day} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

1. The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell. Therefore, the price of a gold Jewell is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. Therefore, the price of a silver Jewell is:
   \[
   1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum up the prices of all three jewels:
\[
2000 \text{ (diamond)} + 1600 \text{ (gold)} + 1200 \text{ (silver)} = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4,800.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   - Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   - Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
   - Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \( 16 + 3 = 19 \).

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   - Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
   - Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \( 19 - 9 = 10 \).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
- Snowflake stamps: 16
- Truck stamps: 19
- Rose stamps: 10

Total number of stamps = \( 16 + 19 + 10 \)

Calculating the sum:

answer:  To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class that is below $10 and then see how many classes he can miss without exceeding this limit.

First, let's find the maximum cost per class that is below $10:
\[ \text{Maximum cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since the maximum cost per class must be below $10, we can assume the maximum cost per class is $9.999 (which is just below $10).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 classes if he attends all the classes:
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 classes} = 10 \times 9.999 = 99.99 \]

To keep the total cost below $100 (since the limit per class is $10), Manny needs to attend fewer than 10 classes. Therefore, he can miss up to 10 classes.

So, Manny can miss up to 9 classes before his parents don't sign him up again.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Alisa = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
- Distance Alisa = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Stanley = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
- Distance Stanley = 25 miles

Now, we add the distancesiked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance they biked:
- Total Distance = Distance Alisa + Distance Stanley
- Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
- Total Distance = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{Volume} \times \text{Time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

answer:  To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their daily production rates and then extend that to a weekly basis.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel, so she processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total daily production for both:
\[ \text{Total daily production} = \text{Jewel's daily production} + \text{Julie's daily production} \]
\[ \text{Total daily production} = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers per day} \]

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the total daily production by the number of days in a week:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily production} \times \text{Number of days in a week} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers.

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this relative speed. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Here, the distance is 75 miles and the speed is 15 miles per hour.

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine how many whole eggs are required for those deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

Next, we need to determine how many whole eggs are required for those deviled egg halves:
- Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 halves.
- Therefore, for 48 halves, she will need 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 whole eggs.

Finally, we convert the number of whole eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens of eggs = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour, and he needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.

\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the rate of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, and he needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.

\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add the time for digging through the soil and the time for digging through the clay to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill a total of 10 hours to dig the well.

answer:  Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as \( L \) miles.

According to the problem:
- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.
- Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran \( L + 3 \) miles.

Since the total distance run by Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley is the same, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

answer:  To determine the total cooking time for all the food, we need to calculate the cooking time for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cooking time for rice:**
   - Rice: 30 minutes

2. **Cooking time for pork:**
   - Pork takes 20 more minutes to cook than rice.
   - Therefore, pork takes 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.

3. **Cooking time for beans:**
   - Beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, beans take 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook.

4. **Total cooking time:**
   - Rice: 30 minutes
   - Pork: 50 minutes
   - Beans: 40 minutes
   - Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

So, the total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes.

\[ \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, he receives a bonus worth half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

Now, let's calculate his total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Finally, let's calculate his annual earnings:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount she made in two months:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100.

The first paid hour costs $15, and each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour. Therefore, the cost for each subsequent hour is 2 * $15 = $30.

Let's calculate the total cost:

1. The first hour costs $15.
2. The second hour costs $30.
3. The third hour costs $30.

Adding these together:

\[ 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \]

Next, determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they share the money equally among them, each would get:

\[ \text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120 if they add their money together and share it equally.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:

\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations. First, we can express \( G \) in terms of \( S \) from the second equation:
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally has received this week.
2. Subtract the amount received from her weekly wage to find out how much was withheld.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sally has received this week:

Sally's bank account started with $200 and ended with $420. The increase in her bank account is:

The total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.50 \]

The total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.50 \]

Now, let's add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost:
\[ 3.50 + 7.50 = 11.00 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he received, we subtract the total cost of the candies from the amount he paid:
\[ 15.00 - 11.00 = 4.00 \]

So, the change Adam received is $4.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of management employees in the company. Since 20% of the employees are management, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the entire company.

answer:  To calculate the total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly maintenance costs.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rent**: $5,000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice as much as the hanger rent, so \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\)

First, let's calculate the total monthly cost:
- Monthly hanger rent: $5,000
- Monthly fuel cost: $10,000
- Total monthly cost: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, let's calculate the total annual cost:
- Total annual cost: $15,000 \times 12 = $180,000

Finally, add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual cost:
- Total cost: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

answer:  Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

First, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, the new length of the dress after extension is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Next, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. Therefore, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda.

Greta bakes 30 cookies.
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so Celinda bakes \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cookies.

The total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) cookies.

Next, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked.

The pair eats 10 cookies.

So, the number of cookies left in the box is \( 90 - 10 = 80 \) cookies.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box.

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week (7 days).

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the donut.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, so there are a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs to buy toys for 12 - 4 = 8 more dogs.
After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he left with 4 dogs, there are now 2 * 4 = 8 more dogs.
So, there are now 4 + 8 = 12 dogs, and James needs to buy toys for 12 - 4 = 8 more dogs.
Since he already bought toys for 8 dogs, he needs to buy toys for 8 - 8 = 0 more dogs.
Finally, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys.
Therefore, James needs to buy toys for 3 - 3 = 0 more toys.
In total, James needs to buy toys for 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8 toys.
James needs a total of 8 toys.

answer:  To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to account for all the days she has already had and subtract the remaining days.

First, let's count the total number of days in the month:
- The month has 30 days.

Next, let's account for the days she has already had:
- The first eight days were good.
- The next eight days were bad.
- The next eight days were neutral.
- The next three days were good, neutral, and good.

So, the total number of days she has already had is:
- 8 (good) + 8 (bad) + 8 (neutral) + 3 (good) = 27 days.

Now, let's calculate the number of good days left in the month:
- The total number of days in the month is 30.
- The number of days she has already had is 27.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
- 30 - 27 = 3 good days.

So, Christina has 3 good days left in the month.

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each sleeps:

\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

answer:  To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs currently available and then compare it to the total number of people attending.

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   - There are 8 high chairs.
   - The number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults.
   - There are 15 babies.
   - Therefore, the total number of people attending is \( 42 + 15 = 57 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   - Total chairs = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
   - Total chairs = 8 + 40 = 48

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - Chairs needed = Total people attending - Total chairs
   - Chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9

Therefore, Mia needs 9 more chairs.

Assume Jack's weight is 70 kg (as an example):
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 70 \text{ kg} = 710 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve this equation for \( S \).

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

To verify, we can check the number of books Janey would have if Sally has 9 books:
\[ 2S + 3 = 2(9) + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

This matches the given information that Janey has 21 books.

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

\[ x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 7 + x + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 3x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 23 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{23}{3} \]
\[ x = 7.67 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 7.67 years. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

First, let's add up the time spent on each homework subject:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total time spent on homework = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, we need to convert the total time John has before dinner from hours to minutes:

answer:  First, determine the total amount of money they need to raise after the first 3 hours:

\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, calculate the amount of money they need to raise per hour:

\[ \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount needed}}{\text{Number of hours already raised}} \]
\[ \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{4200}{3} = 1400 \]

Now, determine the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach the goal:

\[ \text{Total hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount needed}}{\text{Amount per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total hours needed} = \frac{4200}{1400} = 3 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for 6 hours in total to reach their goal of $6300.

answer:  To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deer.
2. Determine the number of bucks.
3. Calculate the number of 8-point bucks.

First, let's find the total number of deer:
\[ \text{Total number of deer} = 50 \]

Next, we calculate the number of bucks. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks:
\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8-point:
\[ \text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks is 5.

answer:  To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Apples:**
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2 per kilo = $<<4=4>>4

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3 per kilo = $<<6=6>>6

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Cost of apples: $4
- Cost of bananas: $4
- Cost of oranges: $6

Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $<<4+4+6=14>>14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

answer:  To determine the price of one crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs $1.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate.
   - Total cost for bananas = 5 bananas * $1/banana = $5

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate.
   - Total cost for apples = 12 apples * $0.5/apple = $6

3. **Oranges:**
   - One banana costs $1.
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs $3.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate.
   - Total cost for oranges = 7 oranges * $3/orange = $21

Now, sum the costs of all the fruits:
$5 + $6 + $21 = $32

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's sum up the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus's loyalty card gives him a 10% discount on the total cost:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

answer:  To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of pencils that can fit in the box.
2. Subtract the number of missing pencils from the total number of pencils.
3. Determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box by dividing the number of pencils in the box by 2.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total number of pencils that can fit in the box is 20.
2. There are 4 pencils missing from the box.
3. To find out how many pencils are currently in the box, we subtract the number of missing pencils from the total number of pencils:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16
   \]
   So, there are 16 pencils in the box.
4. To find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we divide the number of pencils in the box by 2:

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost him $7.00.

1. Adam collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.3 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. Tom collected 30 points less than Betty:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the points:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing \(400 - 255 = 145\) points.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for James to pick the blueberries himself:

1. The cost to go picking is $20.
2. The cost per pound is $1.5, and he picked 30 pounds.

\[ \text{Total cost for picking} = \$20 + (1.5 \times 30) = \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:

1. The cost per pound is $2.5, and he bought 30 pounds.

\[ \text{Total cost at store} = 2.5 \times 30 = \$75 \]

Now, let's find out how much James saved by comparing the total cost of picking the blueberries to the total cost of buying them at the store:

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost at store} - \text{Total cost for picking} = \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself instead of buying them.

1. Calculate the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.
2. Calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, let's find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes:
- Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
- 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 32\% \]

Next, we need to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes. We do this by subtracting the percentage of water used for industrial purposes from 100%.

So, the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that the City Colorado uses for non-industrial purposes is 68%.

- The potential damage to the car is $450.

Now, let's calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:
- The total cost of fixing the pothole is $195.
- The potential damage to the car is $450.

So, the savings is:
\[ $450 - $195 = $255 \]

Each seat holds 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks, so each seat contains 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 items.
Therefore, the total number of items needed is 20 * 6 = 120 items.
Since each item costs $2, the total cost for 120 items is 120 * $2 = $240.
Thus, the group has spent $240 overall on snacks and drinks.

answer:  To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal: for every 2 scoops, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 2 scoops she buys, she effectively gets 3 scoops.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 2 scoops, she pays \(2 \times 1.50 = $3.00\).

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of 2 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

So, Erin can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops. For each set of 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total (2 scoops + 1 free scoop).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she gets is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream to get the most out of the deal with her $6.00.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Distance is found by multiplying speed by time.

The turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, and the time is 40 seconds. Therefore, the distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Each pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

answer:  First, let's determine the rate at which the factory produces each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Next, we calculate the total amount of each type of ice cream made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, we add the total amounts of both types of ice cream to find the total:
- 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts.

Answer: 3000 quarts.

answer:  To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers.

First, let's calculate the new price of each computer:

The original price of each computer is $700. A 10% increase means the new price is:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price is $385,000.

大家可以看到，经过详细计算后，我们得出的总金额是 $385,000。如果您有任何其他问题或需要进一步的帮助，请随时告诉我。

answer:  Each person ordered one pizza, so there are a total of 5 pizzas.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so there are a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each person had 12 slices, each of these two ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

So, Bryce and his two friends ate a total of 8 + 8 = 16 slices.

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Since each person had 12 slices, each of these two ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices.

So, the other two friends ate a total of 9 + 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

The total number of slices left is 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

1. Determine how many books Steven has.
2. Determine how many books Alice has.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books and has two times as many books as Steven. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, Alice has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Total number of spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Number of blue spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

Now, we calculate the percentage of blue spools:
Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40%

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to determine the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

- Right foot: 300 taps/minute × 5 minutes = 1500 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute × 5 minutes = 1250 taps

Total taps with arms at sides = 1500 + 1250 = 2750 taps

Next, let's calculate the total number of taps Helga makes in 2 minutes with her arms raised:

- Right foot: 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps

Total taps with arms raised = 400 + 400 = 800 taps

Finally, let's combine the taps from both scenarios:

The kids want 2 smores each and there are 9 kids:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ smores} \]

The adults want 1 smore each and there are 6 adults:
\[ 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of smores needed:

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, and each box contains 3 sleeves. Therefore, each box makes:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ smores} \]

To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores each box can make:

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the dog takes:
\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the average time by dividing the total time by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

answer:  If a gallon jar costs $5, and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars, so she spent 10 * $5 = $50 on gallon jars.

She also bought 16 half-gallon jars, so she spent 16 * $3 = $48 on half-gallon jars.

The total amount of money she spent is $50 + $48 = $98.

answer:  Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
\[ 90\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \]
So, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

She then trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \]
So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons:
\[ 20 \text{ large stickers} \times 3 \text{ small buttons per large sticker} = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Adding the large buttons and small buttons together:
\[ 27 \text{ large buttons} + 60 \text{ small buttons} = 87 \text{ buttons} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = <<3*4=12>>12 ounces of water.
- Medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = <<7*2=14>>14 ounces of water.
- Small cubes: 8 small cubes * 1/2 ounce per cube = <<8*1/2=4>>4 ounces of water.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = <<12+14+4=30>>30 ounces of water.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

32 ounces (initial) - 30 ounces (used) = <<32-30=2>>2 ounces of water.

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

answer:  To find the price of the bag after a 5% discount, you need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]

Given:
- Original Price = $140
- Discount Percentage = 5%

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Next, subtract the discount amount from the original price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the price after discount is $133.

answer:  To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to find the total number of animals she needs to groom and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the total number of animals:
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12

   Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

2. Determine the number of days in a week:
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. Divide the total number of animals by the number of days:
   Animals per day = Total animals / Number of days
   Animals per day = 28 / 7

4. Perform the division:
   28 ÷ 7 = 4.142857

Since Melissa can't groom a fraction of an animal, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

5. Round 4.142857 to the nearest whole number:
   4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

answer:  To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Carl has.
2. Determine how many marbles Cal has.
3. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together:
\[ \text{Total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is:

answer:  To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he currently has.

Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance. First, we calculate how much Ava gave him:

\[ \text{Amount Ava gave him} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we add the amount Ava gave him to the money he initially had:

\[ \text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

2. Subtract the number of scared birds from the initial number of birds.
3. Add the number of new birds that joined.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds that were scared away.
Jeremy scared away 1/3 of the birds. Initially, there were 12 birds.
\[ \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Step 2: Subtract the number of scared birds from the initial number of birds.
\[ \text{Number of birds remaining} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Step 3: Add the number of new birds that joined.
After a few minutes, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds.
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is 28.

answer:  To determine how much money the vendor saves in a week, we need to calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor and the new vendor, then find the difference, and finally, calculate the weekly savings.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.50.
- Daily cost from old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.50 per tomato = $250.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.40.
- Daily cost from new vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.40 per tomato = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings:
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly savings:
- Weekly savings = $50 * 7 days = $350.

The tomato vendor saves $350 a week.

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

He gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

He also gets 30 more cards with an average value of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

The total value of all the cards is:
\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the packs from the total value of the cards:
\[ \text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which is \( 2A \).

The total number of people on the council is 33. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the new regulation is equal to the total number of people on the council:

\[ A + 2A = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3A = 33 \]

To find \( A \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ A = \frac{33}{3} \]

\[ A = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, we have:

\[ 2A = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the third house needs \( x = 100 \) cases of shingles.

Therefore, the third house will need \( 100 \) cases of shingles.

answer:  Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates to the party. 

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates he sent out:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we need to account for the broken glasses and plates:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates that are not broken:
- Initial glasses = 96
- Broken glasses = 10
- Total unbroken glasses = 96 - 10 = 86

- Initial plates = 48
- Broken plates = 6
- Total unbroken plates = 48 - 6 = 42

Finally, we add the unbroken glasses and plates to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
- Total unbroken glasses = 86
- Total unbroken plates = 42

86 glasses + 42 = 128

answer:  To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the days they ride three times a day and the days they ride twice as often.

1. **Days they ride three times a day:**
   - They ride 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - Total rides on these days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Days they ride twice as often:**
   - They ride twice as often on 2 days.
   - Normally, they ride 3 times a day, so twice as often means 3 * 2 = 6 rides a day.
   - Total rides on these days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on days they ride three times a day + rides on days they ride twice as often.
   - Total rides = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

answer:  First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Ahmed's books} = 300 \]

Solving for Ahmed's books:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of books Ezra read. Ezra initially read 300 books and then decided to read 150 more:

\[ \text{Total books Ezra read} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, let's find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

\[ \text{Total books read} = \text{Total books Ezra read} + \text{Ahmed's books} \]
\[ \text{Total books read} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, they have read a total of 600 books.

answer:  To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Determine the cost of the oranges.

First, let's calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice:
- To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
- Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:
  \[
  4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg}
  \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the oranges:
- Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
- Therefore, the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
  \[
  20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is:
\[

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:

answer:  Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Thus, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 6 \times 4.5 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

answer:  Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which totals 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining time, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \) hours.

So, she spends \(9 - 3 = 6\) hours playing soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 50\% \]

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
2. Subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make.
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants:
\[ \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3 \text{ per eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Now, divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
\[ \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3 \text{ per ear} \]

For the cars:
- Each car has 4 wheels.
- There are 57 cars.
- Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Each motorcycle has 2 wheels.
- There are 73 motorcycles.

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so there are 400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.
The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.
The cost of a normal movie is $10, so the cost of the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.
The cost of a movie in a series is $6, so the cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

answer:  To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. **Number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

2. **Number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \)

3. **Number of OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the sales are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - 15
   - Number of OLED TVs = 25

Therefore, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

answer:  To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will cover.
3. Calculate how much money John already has.
4. Subtract the amount John has and the amount the school will cover from the total cost of the trip.

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school will cover \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) dollars.
3. John already has $50.
4. To find out how much money John is missing, we subtract the amount he has and the amount the school will cover from the total cost of the trip:
   \[
   \text{Amount missing} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Amount John has} - \text{Amount covered by school}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount missing} = 300 - 50 - 150 = 100
   \]

So, John is missing $100.

answer:  First, let's find the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost $30:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know the total cost of all four pizzas is $64. Therefore, the cost of the two remaining pizzas is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the two remaining pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $2.

answer:  To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of these bottle caps.

First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month. Since he finds 10 bottle caps each day, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days in the month:

\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of these bottle caps. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:

\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

answer:  To determine how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike pays.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The original price of the jeans is $40.
   - The discount is 25% of the original price.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10.

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
   - Sale price = Original price - Discount amount = $40 - $10 = $30.

3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike pays:
   - Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.
   - Amount left = Amount paid - Sale price = $50 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

answer:  To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the minimum temperature during the night and then determine how much additional heat is needed to keep the temperature above 32 degrees.

1. Calculate the minimum temperature during the night:
   - Day temperature: 45 degrees
   - Night temperature: 33 degrees colder
   - Night temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

2. Determine the additional heat needed to keep the temperature above 32 degrees:
   - Minimum safe temperature: 32 degrees
   - Night temperature: 12 degrees
   - Additional heat needed = 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

3. Calculate the number of logs needed to provide the additional heat:
   - Each log heats the house by 5 degrees
   - Additional heat needed: 20 degrees
   - Number of logs needed = Additional heat needed / Heat per log
   - Number of logs needed = 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

1. Calculate the points scored by Nikita.
2. Add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita.

First, let's find the points scored by Nikita:
- Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.
- Pierson scored 278 points.
- Half of Pierson's points is \( \frac{278}{2} = 139 \).
- Adding 11 points to 139 gives \( 139 + 11 = 150 \).

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Next, we add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita:
- Pierson's points: 278
- Nikita's points: 150

Total points = Pierson's points + Nikita's points
Total points = 278 + 150
Total points = 428

Therefore, Pierson and Nikita scored a total of 428 points.

answer:  Jack can play for 1 quarter every 20 minutes, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he would use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Each of his two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they each use 12 quarters / 2 = 6 quarters. Since there are two friends, together they use 6 quarters * 2 = 12 quarters.

The third friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he uses 12 quarters * 1.5 = 18 quarters.

In total, they use 12 quarters + 12 quarters + 18 quarters = 42 quarters.

Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, 42 quarters is equal to 42 / 4 = $10.50.

1. For the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for half an hour every day.
   - 2 weeks = 2 * 7 days = 14 days
   - Half an hour in a day = 0.5 hours
   - Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

2. For the next week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
   - 1 week = 7 days
   - Total hours played in the next week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Now, let's add the hours played in both periods:
- Total hours played so far = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
- Hours still needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

So, Kris still needs to play for an additional 9 hours to earn the achievement.

answer:  To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

**First car:**
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles per hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

**Second car:**
- Speed: 70 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles per hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

Next, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:

- Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
- Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles

Difference = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles.

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, after selling and giving some to his mother, Joe remains with:

   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we add up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picks:

1. 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Adding these together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that are lost due to the wind:

- 1 flower is lost from each of the 4 categories, so a total of 4 flowers are lost.

Now, let's calculate the total number of petals on the remaining flowers:

101 petals - 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 101 petals - 24 petals = 77 petals

Therefore, the final answer is 77 petals.

answer:  To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25 and he made $105 during the week, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Now, we know Felix climbed 420 branches during the week. To find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week (7 days):

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed **60 branches** per day.

answer:  To determine the total amount James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold.
2. Calculate the amount of the premium.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

First, let's find the total cost of the diamond and gold:
- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300
- Total cost of diamond and gold: $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we calculate the amount of the premium:
- Premium rate: 30%
- Premium amount: 30% of $900
- Premium amount: $900 * 0.30 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to find the total amount paid:
- Total amount paid: Total cost of diamond and gold + Premium amount
- Total amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170.

answer:  To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

So, the total cost of the goats is:
\[ 3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = \$1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

So, the total cost of the cows is:
\[ 2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = \$3000 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500 \]

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

So, the final answer is:

answer:  Let's denote the amount of salt used as \( S \) ounces. According to the problem, Tanya uses:

- The same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so fragrance is \( S \) ounces.
- The same amount of salt as sugar, so sugar is \( S \) ounces.
- Twice as much oil as salt, so oil is \( 2S \) ounces.
- Twice as much salt as zest, so zest is \( S \) ounces.

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all the ingredients:
\[ S + S + S + S + 2S = 5S \]

We know that the total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so:
\[ 5S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

So, Tanya uses 2 ounces of salt. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2S = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Add the times from both days to get the total time.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, she walked:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we convert the time on the second day into minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the times from both days to get the total time:

answer:  To determine how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money raised by the students.
2. Divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

First, let's find the total amount of money raised by the students:

Total amount raised by the charity: $175,000
Amount raised by organizations: $50,000

Total amount raised by the students = Total amount raised by the charity - Amount raised by organizations
Total amount raised by the students = $175,000 - $50,000
Total amount raised by the students = $125,000

Next, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Number of students = 20

Amount raised by each student = Total amount raised by the students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam has 3 large apples:

Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam has 5 small apples:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices} + 15 \text{ slices} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

answer:  Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150 of them. So, the number of candies left is:

\[ 100 - 150 = -50 \]

Since he can't have negative candies, it means he has sold all of his initial stock and has 50 candies left.

Then, he ordered 100 more butterscotch candies. So, the total number of candies he has now is:

\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \]

To sell all of his candy, Dale needs to sell:

\[ 150 \]

But since he has already sold 150, he doesn't need to sell any more. However, if he were to sell the remaining candies, he would need to sell:

\[ 150 - 150 = 0 \]

So, he doesn't need to sell any more candies to sell all of his candy.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 0 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food:
- Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
- Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than tins of dog food.

- Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
- The number of additional items is 6 mirrors + 2 chandeliers + 20 pictures = 28 items.
- Each additional item costs $15.00.
- Therefore, the cost for the additional items is 28 items * $15.00 per item = $420.00.

Finally, let's find the total cost by adding the base package cost and the cost of the additional items:
- Total cost = Base package cost + Cost of additional items
- Total cost = $129.00 + $420.00
- Total cost = $549.00

So, the total cost for Angela to have all the items installed is $549.00.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards.

Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

answer:  To determine the total number of homes the town will build over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town will build three times as many homes as in the first year.
   - Therefore, \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) homes.

3. **Third Year:**
   - The town will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double that amount.
   - The total number of homes built in the first two years is \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Therefore, \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \) homes.

Now, we sum the number of homes built each year:
\[ 12 \text{ (first year)} + 36 \text{ (second year)} + 96 \text{ (third year)} = 144 \]

So, the town will build 144 homes over the next three years.

answer:  To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left.
   - Length of the first glue stick left: \( \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left.
   - Length of the second glue stick left: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left.
   - Length of the third glue stick left: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the remaining glue sticks:
- Total length = Length of the first glue stick left + Length of the second glue stick left + Length of the third glue stick left
- Total length = 2 millimeters + 8 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters

- Second week: \( \frac{8000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: \( 3 \times 8000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, add these amounts together to find the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \]

answer:  Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \). Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:

\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total distance covered by four turtles in time \( t \) hours is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2v \times t \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up the equation:

\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]

Dividing both sides by \( v \):

\[ 54 = 2t \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

\[ 2 \times \text{Jack's socks} = 60 \]

Solving for the number of socks Jack has:

\[ \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, we know Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:

\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Peter also has half times as many dishes as Jack:

\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

answer:  The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production from the 3 cows is:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many more cows are required to produce 10 more liters of milk a day. We do this by dividing the additional milk needed by the milk production of one cow:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to meet his goal of 25 liters of milk a day.

1. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in reduces the price by $200. Therefore, the discounted price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika received:
- $150 from her part-time job
- $80 from her mom
- $50 more to buy the laptop

The total amount of money Erika has received is:
\[ 150 + 80 = 280 \]

She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she currently has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

To find the amount of money she already had in her purse, we subtract the amount she has received from the total amount she currently has:
\[ S = 350 - 230 \]
\[ S = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika already has $120 dollars in her purse.

According to the problem, you are three years younger than your brother, so your age is \( B - 3 \).

You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

answer:  To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell.
2. Determine the number of glasses sold by Micah.
3. Find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

First, we know that the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell is:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

answer:  To determine how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges given to her three daughters.
2. Add the number of oranges given to her boy.
3. Subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her three daughters:
- Each daughter received 2 oranges.
- There are 3 daughters.
- Total oranges given to daughters = 2 oranges/daughter * 3 daughters = 6 oranges.

Next, let's add the number of oranges given to her boy:
- The boy received 3 oranges.
- Total oranges given away = 6 oranges (daughters) + 3 oranges (boy) = 9 oranges.

Finally, let's subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
- Initial number of oranges = 12 oranges.
- Total oranges given away = 9 oranges.
- Oranges remaining = 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The answer is 3.

answer:  First, determine how many trays are needed to hold the 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling each tray at $2.5 per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, let's calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.10:

\[ 800 \times 0.10 = 80 \]

Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so she received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, let's find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1520 in tips altogether.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item:

1. Bacon: 5 packs cost $10, so each pack costs $10/5 = $2.
2. Chicken: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs 2 * $2 = $4.
3. Strawberries: 3 packs cost $4 each, so the total cost is 3 * $4 = $12.
4. Apples: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4/2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs, so the total cost is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $4 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $40

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount of money left in her budget is:
$65 - $40 = $25

Kelly has $25 left in her budget.

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, calculate the total time required to clean these rooms. Each room takes 20 minutes to clean:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

answer:  To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins and then add the number of gold coins.

We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Given that \( G = 70 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 110 coins.

answer:  To determine the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost per bottle of soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

- Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

answer:  To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount of water:**
   - The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After a day of heavy rain:**
   - The amount of water passing through the river doubles.
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is:
     \[
     4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **On the third day:**
   - The volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is:
     \[
     8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

It takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so it takes Amber 2 * 1 = 2 months to earn a badge.
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 * 1 = 3 badges in 1 month.
In a 1 year time frame, there are 12 months.
So, Claire earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges in 1 year.
Amber earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges in 1 year, but since it takes Amber 2 months to earn a badge, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges in 1 year.
Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in 1 year.
To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to the seller:
\[ \text{Change} = \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change.

answer:  First, let's determine how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim uses to go fishing:

- Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, he uses:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box:

- Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes. After using 3, he has:
  \[
  7 - 3 = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes}
  \]

- Initially, Tim has 9 red shoe boxes. After using 3, he has:
  \[
  9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}
  \]

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box.

The final answer is:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes} \quad 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}

answer:  Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the length of her final concert is \( 2x \) minutes.

Additionally, she performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert itself and the length of the encore:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we need to solve this equation:

1. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 2x + 15 - 15 = 65 - 15 \]
   \[ 2x = 50 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Answer: \( \boxed{25} \) minutes

answer:  To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts:

\[ \text{Cost per bolt} = \$0.03 \]
\[ \text{Number of bolts} = 16 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 0.03 \times 16 = \$0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:

\[ \text{Total money David has} = \$12.48 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of bolts} = \$0.48 \]

\[ \text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, after paying for the bolts, David has \$12.00 left.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:

\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:

\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily diet. Therefore, the cost of the carrots is:

\[ \text{Cost of carrots} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:

\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\text{Cost of carrots}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

answer:  To find the total number of acres on both farms, we first need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this gives:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Next, we add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 \text{ acres} + 500 \text{ acres} = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres on both farms together is 700 acres.

answer:  To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add up the birds he sees in each category:

1. **Birds nesting in the bushes:**
   Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

2. **Birds flying overhead:**
   Jerry counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of birds nesting in the bushes flying overhead. Since there are 6 birds nesting in the bushes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds flying overhead}
   \]

3. **Birds feeding:**
   Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds feeding}
   \]

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding birds)} = 34 \text{ birds}

answer:  Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, so he plans to sell:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens} \]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, and he plans to sell each chicken at $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars} \]

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to spend:

\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens for $7000, the cost per chicken is:

\[ \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken} \]

Therefore, Isaias bought each chicken for approximately $38.89.

First, we set up the equation:
\[ \text{Speed of whatchamacallit} = 11 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} \]
\[ 121 = 11 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} \]

To find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now. In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be \( x + y \).

We want this age to be thrice her present age:
\[ x + y = 3x \]

Substituting \( x = 8 \):
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years from now, her age will be thrice her present age.

First, let's find out how many years Martha has been collecting shells:
- Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.
- By her 10th birthday, she will be 10 years old.
- Therefore, she has been collecting shells for \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) years.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of months in these 5 years:

- Therefore, in 5 years, there are \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells:
- Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Thus, the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday is \( 60 \).

He has also seen 8 movies on other days, so he has spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those tickets.
He spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn.
He spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.
In total, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.
Colby has $150 to spend, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.
On Friday, he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.
So, he has $20 - $10 = $10 left.
Each movie ticket on Friday or Saturday costs $10, so he can buy $10 / $10 = 1 movie ticket.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$12 \text{ per hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$480 \]

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

\[ \boxed 480 \]

answer:  First, let's determine how long it takes for John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. Since a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, an extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long:

\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours because John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to determine how many half-hour intervals are in 3 hours. There are 2 half-hours in an hour, so:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

answer:  To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Determine the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday.
3. Calculate Colby's earnings for the entire workday.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes per hour. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we have:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday:
\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Finally, we calculate Colby's earnings for the entire workday:
\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Colby earns \boxed{64} dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.

answer:  First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha initially had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially had.

\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Let \( J \) represent the number of notebooks Joseph had.

\[ J = 3M \]
\[ J = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 6 \]

So, Joseph initially had 6 notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has:

\[ M + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

answer:  To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys that Sophie already has.
2. Subtract the total number of toys from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie already has:

- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

So, Sophie initially has 48 toys.

Next, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the initial number of toys from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

answer:  To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works twice 5 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works 2 hours less than 10 hours, which is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we add up the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ hours (Thursday)}
\]

So, the total is:
\[
5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all over the three days.

\[ \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars} = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream:
\[ 11 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} + 7 \text{ dollars} \times 2 = 11 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} + 14 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had initially is $28. Therefore, each of them received:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them:

answer:  To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance for both Zoey and Sydney, and then find the average of those distances.

Zoey's total distance:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.
- Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney's total distance:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.
- Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Next, we find the total distance for both:
- Total distance for both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Finally, we calculate the average distance:
- Average distance = Total distance for both / Number of people
- Number of people = 2 (Zoey and Sydney)
- Average distance = 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.

answer:  Calvin's family consists of 2 adults and 2 children, making a total of 4 people.
Calvin's pot has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.
Since everyone will eat one bowl for the meal, the total number of bowls needed is 4.
Since the pot has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, it has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.
To find out how many times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to divide the total number of bowls by the number of children.
Since there are 2 children and they will have a total of 8 child's bowls (from the pot), each child will have 8 / 2 = 4 bowls of soup.
Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times from the leftover soup.

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Since each row contains an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, let's denote the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, each row contains \( 2x \) cups.

Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Since each row contains 9 cups, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 9 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, each row contains 4.5 cups of mint tea.

answer:  To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate the total number of trips he needs to make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours to make one trip, we divide the total time by the time it takes for one trip:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we know the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total. To find out how many berries he can pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to meet his goal of 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) hours a day.
3. Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

According to the problem:
- Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, John is 20 years old. Now, we can find Peter's age:

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.
Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * $6 = $259200.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 * $6 = $194400.
Fern makes $259200 - $194400 = $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 in the same time period.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, he has:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (measuring cups and measuring spoons) Jonathan has remaining. He has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]

answer:  First, calculate the cost of a 24-hour stay:
- 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, calculate the cost of a 12-hour stay:
- 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Now, calculate the cost of the additional stay after 12 hours:
- Cameron stays for 5 hours after 12 hours.
- The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.
- Total cost for 5 additional hours = 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

Add the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional stay:
- Total cost for 12-hour stay + additional stay = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Finally, subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
- Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Thus, Cameron would save 250 pesos.

answer:  First, let's determine how many slices of bread Abby and Josh each eat per day.

- Abby eats 2 slices per day.
- Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices eaten per day by Abby and Josh:
- Total slices per day = Abby's slices per day + Josh's slices per day
- Total slices per day = 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day

Now, we need to find out how many days the 24-slice loaf of bread will last if they eat 6 slices per day.

- Total slices of bread = 24
- Total slices per day = 6

To find the number of days, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices eaten per day:
- Number of days = Total slices of bread / Total slices per day
- Number of days = 24 / 6
- Number of days = 4

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days if Abby and Josh eat their amounts of slices per day.

answer:  To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to correct for the 20% overstatement that Courtney reported.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

Courtney reported 48 people, which is 120% of the actual number of people. We can express this relationship as:
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

First, let's find the number of children per school:
- There are 7 rows per school.
- Each row has 8 children.

So, the number of children per school is:
\[ 7 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ children/row} = 56 \text{ children} \]

Next, we multiply the number of children per school by the number of schools:
- There are 5 schools.

So, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

answer:  To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Number of yams: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ 9 \text{ (yams)} + 20 \text{ (sweet potatoes)} + 5 \text{ (carrots)} = 34 \]

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150

Next, apply the 40% discount:

150 * 40% = $60

So the cost after the discount is:

150 - 60 = $90

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs, so he keeps 5 CDs:

10 CDs - 5 CDs = 5 CDs

Each CD costs $15, so the cost for the 5 CDs he keeps is:

5 CDs * $15 per CD = $75

He sells the 5 CDs he cares about for $40:

5 CDs * $40 = $20

The total amount he has after selling the CDs is:

$75 + $20 = $95

To find out how much money he was out, subtract the amount he has from the initial cost:

$100 - $95 = $5

Therefore, James was out $5.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets based on the percentage increase.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total cost.

1. The cost of the supplies is $400.
2. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the travel tickets, we calculate 50% of $400 and add it to $400.
   - 50% of $400 = 0.50 * $400 = $200
   - Therefore, the cost of the travel tickets = $400 + $200 = $600

3. The total cost of the travel is the sum of the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets.
   - Total cost = Cost of supplies + Cost of travel tickets
   - Total cost = $400 + $600 = $1000

So, the travel costs $1000.

answer:  To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours

Distance traveled by the bus = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car: 8 hours

Distance traveled by the car = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference in distance = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The answer is 60 miles.

- New York Times: 10% commission on $5 per copy = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50 per copy
- Wall Street Journal: 8% commission on $15 per copy = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20 per copy

Next, calculate the total commission for each type of newspaper:

- New York Times: 6 copies * $0.50 per copy = $3.00
- Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * $1.20 per copy = $12.00

Finally, add the total commissions from both types of newspapers to find the total commission:

- Total commission = $3.00 (New York Times) + $12.00 (Wall Street Journal) = $15.00

So, Cayley will earn a total of $15.00 in commission from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, each costing $5 and $15 respectively.

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Initially, the number of unoccupied beds is:

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

answer:  To find the total cost of both cars, we first need to determine the price of the red car. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

The price of the blue car is given as:

\[ \text{Price of the blue car} = \$100 \]

The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find 40% of the blue car's price, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Price of the blue car} + \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

So, the total cost of both cars is:

\[ \$160 \]

answer:  To determine the total number of balls the coach brought to practice, we need to use the information given and set up an equation.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls carried by Jeffrey.
2. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.
4. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \).
5. Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \).

Now, we know:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by all three boys:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

answer:  First, calculate the distance James swims:
60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Next, calculate the time it takes him to swim this distance:
Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Now, calculate the distance remaining to swim after the rest:
20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

James rests for half as long as his swimming time:
Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

After resting, James swims the remaining distance at half his speed:
New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

Calculate the time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles:
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Finally, add up all the times to get the total time:
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swim time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

It took James 17 hours to get across the lake.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug on the first three days:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes after the first three days = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes on the first day, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day must be:

Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes after the first three days from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:

Holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes by the end of the fourth day - Total holes after the first three days
Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 31
Holes dug on the fourth day = 9 holes

answer:  Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, calculate the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

answer:  To find Leo's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Marcus's age.
2. Use the information that Marcus is half of Leo's age to find Leo's age.

First, let's find Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 \]
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{\text{Leo's age}}{2} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{\text{Leo's age}}{2} \]

To find Leo's age, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 42 \]

So, Leo is \(\boxed{42}\) years old.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of episodes.
2. Calculate the total duration of all the episodes.
3. Convert the total duration into minutes.

First, let's find the number of episodes:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.
- Therefore, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Next, we calculate the total duration of all the episodes:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are 10 episodes.
- Therefore, the total duration is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total duration into minutes:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the total duration in hours is \( \frac{200}{60} = \frac{333}{60} \approx 3.33 \) hours.

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Next, we need to determine the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \]

So, Nani's sister is 2 years younger than Nani. Therefore, Nani's sister's age is:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:

\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Thus, the total age of all three of the family members is:

answer:  To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = \text{perimeter} \times \text{slats per foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ slats/foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

On that day, she woke up at 2:15 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so she woke up at 2:15 a.m. - 5 minutes = 2:10 a.m.

The total time she was awake that day is from 2:10 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 28 minutes.

Therefore, the total time she slept on her bed that day is:

8 hours (usual time) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 28 minutes (awake) = 7 hours and 19 minutes.

Converting this to minutes:

1. Low mode for 3 hours: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees
2. High mode for 4 hours: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

Total cooling effect = 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Next, let's calculate the warming effect of the room without the air conditioner:

1. Room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
2. The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.

Warming effect = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's determine the net cooling effect:

Net cooling effect = Total cooling effect - Warming effect
Net cooling effect = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Since the net cooling effect is 14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.

Let's calculate each step:

- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so she gave her \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so she gave her \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total number of beads: \( 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \)

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads.

answer:  Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold three and a half boxes, which can be written as \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold four and a half boxes, which can be written as \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

The total number of chocolate bars sold by both Lisa and Peter is given as 64. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

answer:  To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots.
3. Divide the total size by 2 to find the average.

First, let's find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we calculate:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots:

\[ \text{Total size} = \text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total size by 2 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the boots worn by the two is 15.

answer:  John decides to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which means he buys a total of 4 phones.

The price of each phone is $600, but each phone after the first two is half price.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first two phones:
\[ 2 \text{ phones} \times \$600 \text{ per phone} = \$1200 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the remaining two phones. Since each of these phones is half price, the price for each of these phones is:
\[ \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for these two phones:
\[ 2 \text{ phones} \times \$300 \text{ per phone} = \$600 \]

Finally, let's add the costs of all four phones to find the total cost:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
\[ V = 14 \, \text{ft} \times 25 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 5.9:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times \$0.10/\text{gallon} = \$82.6 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, so 4 sunflowers will use \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, so 10 carnations will use \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together gives the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

answer:  First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the flowers is given in inches:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Each flower is 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, let's calculate how many plants are needed to fill the flower bed:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44 plants

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 more plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the 27 additional plants is:

27 plants * $6/plant = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Each plum costs $0.25, so to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
$0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the remaining money.

answer:  To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the earnings per session.
2. Calculate the earnings per week.
3. Calculate the earnings per month.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings per session**

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25. The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students.

So, earnings per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40.

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings per week**

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week.

So, earnings per week = $40/session * 3 days/week = $120.

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings per month**

Assume there are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

So, earnings per month = $120/week * 4 weeks/month = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \boxed{480}$.

answer:  Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter as \( P \) and for Martha as \( M \).

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. Since Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box, we calculate the difference:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 \]
\[ P - M = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout the day. Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

Since the first plane makes 88 trips in one day, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F = 22 \).

To find \( F \), the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day, we multiply both sides by 4:

\[
F = 88
\]

Thus, the first plane takes 22 flights to France in one day.

answer:  To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we sum up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

So, they have a total of 34 sticks.

answer:  To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the sequence of events and their respective probabilities:

1. The probability that the substitute teacher does not come is 50%, or 0.50.
2. The probability that the normal teacher gives everyone an extension is 40%, or 0.40.
3. The probability that the whole class does not get an extension is 60%, or 0.60.
4. The probability that Marcus gets a personal extension is 20%, or 0.20.

The overall probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework is the product of these individual probabilities:

\[ 0.50 \times 0.40 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.048 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of this probability:

\[ 1 - 0.048 = 0.952 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 95%.

answer:  To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Speed of Matteo: 55 miles per hour
- Time of Matteo: 4 hours

Distance of Matteo = Speed × Time
Distance of Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Speed of Shandy: 45 miles per hour
- Time of Shandy: 10 hours

Distance of Shandy = Speed × Time
Distance of Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, find the difference in distance between Shandy and Matteo:
Difference in distance = Distance of Shandy - Distance of Matteo
Difference in distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
In total, Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.
The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so there are 18000 - 7500 - 4500 = 6000 gallons remaining.

Next, determine how many pieces Anne kept for herself:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, subtract the number of pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces:
\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave the remaining pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, divide the number of pieces by the number of friends:
\[ 780 \text{ pieces} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

answer:  Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the total charge lost in the first 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 0.09 = 0.45 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the total charge lost in the next 3 hours is:
\[ 3 \times 0.07 = 0.21 \]

The total charge lost over the 8 hours is:
\[ 0.45 + 0.21 = 0.66 \]

The remaining charge is 28%, so:
\[ 0.34x = 0.28 \]

To find the initial charge \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.34} \]
\[ x = 0.84 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was \( 84\% \).

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of money Jim took from his loans over the 4 years: $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

Next, calculate the total amount of money Jim lost by not working during those 4 years: $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

Now, find the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new annual income is: $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

Finally, calculate how many years it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the money he lost from not working while in school.

Finally, we add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 480 = 530

answer:  To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the package with 8 sandwiches:

- Price per sandwich = $1.50
- Number of sandwiches = 8

Total cost = Price per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
Total cost = $1.50 * 8 sandwiches
Total cost = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

- She makes $10 per hour from wages.
- She makes $15 per hour from tips.
- She works 40 hours a week.

Total weekly earnings = ($10 + $15) * 40 hours/week = $25 * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, determine how much Janet needs to save for the downpayment:
- She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car.

Downpayment needed = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Now, calculate the number of weeks she needs to work to save $2,000:
- She earns $1000 per week.

Number of weeks needed = Downpayment needed / Weekly earnings = $2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the downpayment for the car.

answer:  To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team in 3 weeks.
2. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:

- The team worked for 3/8 of a day each day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, each week has 3/8 * 7 = 21/8 = 2.25 days.
- The team worked for 3 weeks, so the total hours worked is 2.25 * 3 = 6.75 hours.

- There are 4 painters in the team.
- Therefore, each painter worked 6.75 / 4 = 1.6875 hours.

So, each painter put in 1.6875 hours of work.

First, let's calculate the total amount Tom has to pay after selling his old bedroom:

- The total cost of the bedroom set is $3000.
- Tom sells his old bedroom for $1000.
- Therefore, the remaining amount he has to pay is:
  \[
  3000 - 1000 = 2000
  \]

Next, we need to determine the monthly payment. Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining balance each month:

- The remaining balance is $2000.
- The monthly payment is 10% of $2000.
- Therefore, the monthly payment is:
  \[
  2000 \times 0.10 = 200
  \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

answer:  To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for the event.
2. Subtract the number of faculty seats from the total number of seats to find the number of seats for graduates.
3. Divide the number of seats for graduates by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Given:
- Total seats available: 6000
- Seats for graduates: 950
- Seats for faculty: 300

First, let's calculate the number of seats for graduates:
\[ \text{Seats for graduates} = \text{Total seats} - \text{Seats for faculty} = 6000 - 300 = 5700 \]

Next, we divide the number of seats for graduates by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Seats for graduates}}{\text{Number of graduates}} = \frac{5700}{950} = 6 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive \boxed{6} tickets.

answer:  To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven.
2. Subtract the distance she has driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven:
- Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- Total distance driven = 325 km/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers.

Next, we subtract the distance she has driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City:
- Total distance from San Diego to New York City = 1955 kilometers.
- Distance already driven = 1300 kilometers.
- Distance still needed = 1955 km - 1300 km = 655 kilometers.

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

answer:  To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pictures in each album.
2. Determine the number of selfies and portraits based on the given albums.

First, let's find the number of pictures in each album:
  - Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
  - She put these pictures into 8 albums.
  - Therefore, each album contains \( \frac{72}{8} = 9 \) pictures.

Next, we calculate the number of selfies and portraits:
  - 3 of the albums were selfies only.
  - So, the number of selfies is \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \).
  - 2 of the albums were portraits.
  - So, the number of portraits is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \).

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to find the total:
  - Total portraits and selfies = 27 (selfies) + 18 (portraits) = 45.

Thus, Olivia had 45 portraits and selfies.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard needs to place.
2. Determine the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find the number of soda bottles Richard needs to place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we know that it takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is the number of bottles multiplied by the time to move between bottles.

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, it will take Richard a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

answer:  First, determine the dimensions of the pieces of fabric Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the new dimensions will be:

- Length of each piece of fabric: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width of each piece of fabric: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, multiply the area of one piece by 2:

\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

answer:  To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

First, let's convert Xavier's height from feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's determine Cole's new height:
Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:

answer:  Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of tennis balls retrieved is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]
\[ 5x = 30 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \) tennis balls.

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 per month.
- The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

Now, add this to the normal cost to get the increased monthly cost:
\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

answer:  To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken salad:
- 10 people want the chicken salad.
- The cost per person for the chicken salad is $6.50.
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $<<10*6.50=65>>65

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pasta salad:
- 6 people want the pasta salad.
- The cost per person for the pasta salad is $6.
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6/person = $<<6*6=36>>36

Now, we add the total costs of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering:
- Total cost = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
- Total cost = $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101

answer:  First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy 1 pound and get one half off. This means for every pound you buy, you only pay for half a pound. Therefore, to get 6 pounds of butter, you only need to pay for:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

The butter costs $4.00 per pound. So, the cost for 3 pounds of butter is:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is:

\[ \$12.00 \]

The final answer is:

\[ \$12.00 \]

answer:  To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Each cat is fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, each cat consumes:
\[ 2 \text{ feeds/day} \times 60 \text{ grams/feed} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Imma has 3 cats, so the total amount of cat food consumed by all three cats in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 120 \text{ grams/cat/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

answer:  To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he uses per week and then extend that to a year.

First, let's calculate the number of sets of sheets Greg uses per week:
- He uses 4 twin beds per week.
- He uses 1 king-size bed per week.

Each twin bed requires 2 sets of sheets, so 4 twin beds require \(4 \times 2 = 8\) sets of sheets.
Each king-size bed requires 1 set of sheets, so 1 king-size bed requires \(1 \times 1 = 1\) set of sheets.

In total, Greg uses \(8 + 1 = 9\) sets of sheets per week.

Next, we need to find out how many sets of sheets he uses in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he uses \(9 \times 52 = 468\) sets of sheets in a year.

Since each set of sheets requires one load of laundry to wash, Greg needs to do 468 loads of laundry in a year.

answer:  Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

answer:  To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books.
2. Calculate the number of German books.
3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

First, let's find the number of English books:
- Half of the books are written in English.
- Total books = 50
- Number of English books = 50 / 2 = 25

Next, let's find the number of German books:
- 10% of the books are written in German.
- Total books = 50
- Number of German books = 10% of 50 = 0.10 * 50 = 5

Now, subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books:
- Number of Spanish books = Total books - Number of English books - Number of German books
- Number of Spanish books = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of slices from the 4 pizzas. Since each pizza has 8 slices, we have:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, and Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Now, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia to find the total number of slices eaten:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices eaten is:

- Going back home: 2 miles

Total distance = 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

The theater rental fee is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since a party of 20 is the base fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for additional guests is $6 per guest:
Total cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

answer:  Let \( D \) be the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of the time for Betsy's part and Donovan's part, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, determine how much money Jenny had initially. She used five 5 dollar bills, so she had:

Subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount of money Jenny had to find out how much change she received:
\[ \$25 - \$20 = \$5 \]

Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to convert the change into quarters. Each dollar is equivalent to 4 quarters, so:

\[ \$5 = 4 \text{ quarters} \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with:

answer:  To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests.
2. Add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests.
3. Divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
\[ \text{Total score for first 3 tests} = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \]

Next, add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests:
\[ \text{Total score for all 4 tests} = 300 + 80 = 380 \]

Finally, divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{\text{Total score for all 4 tests}}{4} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

answer:  The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

answer:  To determine how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one minute.
2. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour.
3. Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours.
4. Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.

1. One spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.
2. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so one spring creates 60 jellyfish in one minute.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so one spring creates 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish in one hour.
4. Over 4 hours, one spring creates 3600 * 4 = 14400 jellyfish.
5. Therefore, 5 springs would create 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish.

In total, 5 springs would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of sodas left after Ellen and her brother took some.

1. Ellen initially had 12 sodas.
2. She shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas.
3. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so there are 8 unshaken sodas left.
4. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

The total number of sodas left is:
\[ 2 \text{ shaken sodas} + 6 \text{ unshaken sodas} = 8 \text{ sodas} \]

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas, expressed as a percentage.

answer:  To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all trucks.
2. Subtract the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to mechanical failures.

First, let's calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all trucks:
\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ trucks} = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 5 trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser:
\[ 5 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 100 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, let's determine the savings by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

answer:  Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount Harry gets from the total amount:
\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence left.

answer:  To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck over the 6-hour day.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
- Bales left = Bales produced by the farmer - Bales picked up by the truck
- Bales left = 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas/day.

Over a week (7 days), the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys is:
24 bananas/day * 7 days = 168 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week. The total number of bananas bought is 315, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas in a week by 7:
147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas/day.

answer:  To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first train:**
   - Speed of the first train: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second train:**
   - Speed of the second train: Half of the first train's speed, which is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

3. **Total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since they are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is \( \frac{T}{2} \).

2. A pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{4} \).

3. A group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so \( \frac{T}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{4} = 270 \]

Multiply both sides by 4:
\[ T = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ T = 1080 \]

So, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

answer:  To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest waterslide: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest waterslide: 80 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.

The answer is 2 minutes.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:

answer:  First, let's determine the initial number of male and female fish in Tate's pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's account for the additional fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Total number of female fish: 8 + 8 = 16
Total number of male fish: 6 + 5 = 11

Finally, the difference between the number of female fish and male fish is:

- 16 - 11 = 5

answer:  To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Let \( P \) be the total school population. According to the problem, 40% of \( P \) is equal to 240. We can write this as:

\[ 0.40P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, the remaining 60% is made up of girls. Therefore, the number of girls is 60% of the total school population:

\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is \( 360 \).

answer:  To determine how many hours Bobby spends on lunches and breaks after 5 days, we first need to calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks per day.

1. **Lunch time per day:** 30 minutes
2. **Break time per day:** 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long
3. **Total time per day:** 30 minutes + 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, we calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks over 5 days:

1. **Total time per day:** 60 minutes
2. **Number of days:** 5
3. **Total time over 5 days:** 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

1. **Total time in minutes:** 300 minutes
2. **Total time in hours:** 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to a total of 5 hours.

answer:  First, determine the height from which the ball is initially dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate the height of the first bounce. The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height of the first bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, calculate the height of the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height of the second bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball goes to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce.

\[ \boxed{32} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = $27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = $55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = $75 \)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

Therefore, the store will have received $157 $<<157=157>>157 after all the balls are sold.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so they produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so they produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
Together, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour shift, the first four workers produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 20 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we need to find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces.

The fifth worker produces 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north wall: 10 feet x 8 feet = 80 square feet
- The south wall: 10 feet x 8 feet = 80 square feet
- The east wall: 5 feet x 8 feet = 40 square feet
- The west wall: 5 feet x 8 feet = 40 square feet

Next, we sum up the areas of all four walls:

Total area = 80 square feet + 80 square feet + 40 square feet + 40 square feet = 240 square feet

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required to cover 240 square feet. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet:

Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint:

Total cost = 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144

Therefore, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, let's find half of the circumference of the earth:
\[ \text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find this, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

answer:  To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of people from the cars:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Total people from cars = 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

Next, let's calculate the number of people from the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Total people from buses = 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

Now, we add the number of people from the cars and the buses to find the total number of people inside the church:
- Total people inside the church = Total people from cars + Total people from buses
- Total people inside the church = 60 people + 420 people = 480 people.

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 480.

1. Calculate the total amount Anna has spent so far.
2. Determine the total cost of the books.
3. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, let's calculate the total amount Anna has spent so far:
- Anna had a budget of $16.
- She has already spent $4.
- She has $2 left in her budget.

So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we know that Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book as \( x \).

The total cost of the books is:
\[ 2x \]

Since the total amount spent is $10, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

2. Calculate the amount of apples Paul wants.
3. Subtract the total amount wanted by Peter and Paul from the total amount of apples.

First, we calculate the amount of apples Peter wants:
\[ \text{Peter's apples} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of apples Paul wants:
\[ \text{Paul's apples} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we find the total amount of apples wanted by Peter and Paul:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Peter and Paul} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total distance run by Amber and Micah} = \text{Distance Amber ran} + \text{Distance Micah ran} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find the distance Ahito ran:

- Three women wearing 4-inch heels
- Three women wearing 2-inch heels

Total number of women: \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)

Finally, we divide the total height by the total number of women to find the average:
Average height of heels: \( \frac{18}{6} = 3 \) inches

Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which is \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris gave away \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
5. Therefore, the number of stickers Luis gave to Kris is equal to the number of stickers Kris gave away, which is 16.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

First, we calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} \approx 9.01 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take approximately 9.01 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

Each pack of bagels costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs.
Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $<<4*10.00=40.00>>40.00

Next, let's calculate the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = $40.00 * 0.10 = $<<40.00*0.10=4.00>>4.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $<<40.00-4.00=36.00>>36.00

Finally, let's calculate the cost per bagel:

Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $<<36.00/36=1.00>>1.00

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00.

answer:  To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days.
2. Use the information that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian to find Brian's distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days:
Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days.
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) be the distance Brian will walk in seven days. Therefore, Sofie's distance is twice Brian's distance:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

answer:  To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
- Total number of carrots on weekdays = 5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots.

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).
- Mason eats 5 carrots each weekend day.
- Total number of carrots on weekends = 2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the total number of carrots from weekdays and weekends to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
- Total number of carrots in a week = 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekends) = 30 carrots.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

answer:  Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 of them.

answer:  To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we first need to calculate the total daily energy needed for 2300 people.

Each juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, each juice covers 20% of one person's energy requirement, which is equivalent to 100% of one person's energy requirement.

For 2300 people, the total daily energy needed is:
\[ 2300 \times 2 = 4600 \]

Since each juice covers 20% of one person's energy requirement, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \times 2 = 2600 \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles currently produced from the total number of bottles needed:

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 1600 more bottles of juice to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Sid took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles.
- He took 3 hours to travel the additional 140 miles.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

- One dozen equals 12 eggs.
- Therefore, three dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:
- Chatty has four children.
- So, each child receives \(\frac{36}{4} = 9\) eggs.

Thus, each child receives 9 eggs.

answer:  To find the total duration of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of each song and then sum them together.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Finally, add the lengths of both songs to find the total duration of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is \boxed{13} minutes.

answer:  To find the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **Year 5:** The tree produces 50 fruits.
2. **Year 6:** The tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **Year 7:** The tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **Year 8:** The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so \(600 - 200 = 400\) fruits.
5. **Year 9:** The tree doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **Year 10:** The tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Adding these up, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years is:

answer:  To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

1. The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely than the first ticket, so it is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Now, we multiply these probabilities together:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 0.12, or 12%.

answer:  Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( x \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the second mug. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is then:

\[ 33 + \frac{x}{4} \]

Since Donny can only drink water that is at least 40 degrees, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[ 33 + \frac{x}{4} \geq 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \):

\[ \frac{x}{4} \geq 40 - 33 \]
\[ \frac{x}{4} \geq 7 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 4:

\[ x \geq 7 \times 4 \]
\[ x \geq 28 \]

So, the temperature of the second mug must be at at least 28 degrees.

- Carla has 8 octuplets.
- 3/4 of them are wearing purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies.
- 1/4 of them are wearing blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies.

Next, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows:

- All 2 blue babies are wearing bows.
- 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) babies.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, let's calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

- There are 2 purple babies wearing bows out of the total 4 babies wearing bows.
- The probability is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) or \( 50\% \).

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint used as \( x \) pints each. According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is given as 12 pints. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + x + 6 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( x = 2 \) pints.

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is \( \boxed{2} \).

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so he spent:
\[ 2 \times 20 = \$40 \]

Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so he spent:
\[ 4 \times 20 = \$80 \]

The total amount he spent is:
\[ 40 + 80 = \$120 \]

Linus sells each device for $40, so on Monday, he earned:
\[ 2 \times 40 = \$80 \]

On Tuesday, he earned:
\[ 4 \times 40 = \$160 \]

The total amount he earned is:
\[ 80 + 160 = \$240 \]

The profit is the total amount earned minus the total amount spent:
\[ 240 - 120 = \$120 \]

Therefore, Linus earned $120 in profit after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

1. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in one day.
2. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days.

First, let's find out how many face masks Tyrion uses in one day:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- He goes out three times a day.

So, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ masks/visit} \times 3 \text{ visits/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Next, let's find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- He uses 6 face masks per day.
- He is doing this for 2 days.

So, the number of face masks he uses in 2 days is:
\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses **12 face masks** every 2 days.

According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.

Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:

answer:  Let's denote the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day as \( x \).

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages left.

On the second day, they used 30 bandages, so they had \( (x + 12) - 30 = x - 18 \) bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages, so they had \( (x - 18) + 25 - 25 = x - 18 \) bandages left.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so \( x - 18 = 78 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 + 18 = 96 \]

So, the nurses started with 96 bandages.

answer:  First, let's determine how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. He used 45% of the 5-inch piece:

\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

So, after Monday, the teacher has:

\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Now, the teacher returns to using 20% of the chalk each day. Let's find out how much chalk he uses each day:

\[ 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches per day} \]

The teacher needs to recycle the chalk when it is less than 2 inches. Let's see how many days he can use this chalk:

\[ \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches per day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

answer:  Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50. So, he earned 40 square meters * $50 = $200 from the first sale.

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30. So, he earned 20 square meters * $30 = $60 from the second sale.

After selling the first two parts of his land, he had 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He then sold his remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 square meters * $3 per square meter = $60 from the third sale.

Adding up all the money he earned from selling his land, Abraham earned $200 + $60 + $60 = $320.

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $320 after selling all his unused land.

answer:  Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head.
3. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
4. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
5. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
6. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.

Now, let's add up all the apples Newton picked up:

- He initially picked 2 apples.
- He picked up 5 apples from the tree.
- He picked up 6 apples from the tree.

Adding these up:
\[ 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 \]

So, Newton picked up 13 apples. Since he put one apple in his pocket and threw one apple at the tree, he brought home:
\[ 13 - 1 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, Newton brought home \( 11 \) apples.

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the amount of sour milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:

answer:  First, we need to determine the amount of blood one shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate:

\[ \text{Blood of one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood of one whale} \]

Given that a whale has 40 gallons of blood:

\[ \text{Blood of one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of blood for ten sharks. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we calculate:

\[ \text{Total blood of ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]

answer:  First, calculate the number of apartments in each complex:
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
- The last complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, calculate 60% of 400: 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.

Next, calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
- Total apartments = 200 + 200 + 240 = 640 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, so:
- Total collections per week = 640 apartments * 3 collections per week = 1920 apartments per week.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so:
- Total earnings per week = 1920 apartments * $0.40 per apartment = $768 per week.

Therefore, John makes $768 in a week.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Ali's order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags Ali needs.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, let's find out how many 50 kg bags are needed to supply 850 kg of coal:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per bag}} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} \]

\[ \text{Number of bags} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag costs $18. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost of Ali's order of coal is $306.

answer:  On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees = 60 trees.

On the second day, he planted 30 White Oak trees + 50 Lodgepole Pine trees = 80 trees.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

answer:  Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, so in 15 minutes, he can build 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball.
However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 15 minutes, he can have 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 of a snowball.
Since he needs to have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to reach 60 snowballs.
We can set up the equation: (-1/3) * x = 60, where x is the number of 15-minute intervals.
Solving for x, we get: x = 60 / (-1/3) = -180 / -1 = 180.
So, it will take Jay 180/15 = 120 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

1. Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
2. Use the information about John's age when Digimon came out to find Jim's age at that time.
3. Calculate Jim's current age based on his age when Digimon came out.

1. John is currently 28 years old. Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, John was:
   \[
   28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old when Digimon came out}

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's denote the amount each of them gave as \(x\) dollars.

Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money, so she has \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\) dollars left.

Rissa initially had $15 and has $12 left, so she gave away \(15 - 12 = 3\) dollars.

Since they both gave away the same amount, Ronnie also gave away $3.

Next, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.

The cost of the special size box is $12, and it contains 120 pods. Therefore, the cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.1 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod costs $0.1, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for April:
- April has 4 weeks.
- Her weekly earnings are $77.50.

- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) packs of black pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

Finally, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
- Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
- Total number of pens = 25 + 50 = 75.

answer:  Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \).

1. Wendy's current age is 5 times Colin's age in seven years:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Wendy will be \( W + 25 \) years old. According to the problem, Wendy will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   W + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

3. Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
   \[
   5(C + 7) + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   5C + 50 = 5C + 35
   \]

5. Solve for \( C \):
   \[
   50 = 35
   \]
   \[
   C = 15
   \]

So, Colin is 15 years old.

answer:  Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. Therefore, the height of the house is:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. Therefore, the height of the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the floor to the ceiling on the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is 420 inches tall and the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 180 inches tall, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the remaining height of the house after the first floor:

\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

answer:  First, calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas:
\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

Next, find the number of shells remaining after the Alphas have found their share:
\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, calculate the number of shells found by team The finders:
\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

Then, find the number of shells remaining after the The finders have found their share:
\[ \text{Remaining shells after The finders} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Finally, calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters:
\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of slices needed for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizzas:
- Each friend eats 6 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Total cheese slices needed = 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizzas:
- Each friend eats 4 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Total pepperoni slices needed = 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 24 slices.

Next, let's find the total number of slices needed:
- Total slices needed = 36 slices (cheese) + 24 slices (pepperoni) = 60 slices.

Now, let's determine how many pizzas are needed:
- Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
- Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.

Since we need to know how many pizzas are required, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
- Total pizzas needed = 60 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 5 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 5 pizzas in total.

2. Subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price:
Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. The volume of the jar is 6 inches x 6 inches x 15 inches = 540 cubic inches. Since each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit is 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 3600 jelly beans.

Next, we need to account for the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the actual number of jelly beans in the jar is 3600 jelly beans x 0.80 = 2400 jelly beans.

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2400 jelly beans x 0.30 = 720 red jelly beans.

The true number of red jelly beans in the jar is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is 900 - 720 = 180.

Therefore, Tim's guess was 180 jelly beans.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 10*2 = 20 bottles.

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60*0.5) = $<<60+(60*0.5)=90>>90.

The total cost for the scotch is 10 bottles * $60 = $<<10*60=600>>600.

The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $<<20*90=1800>>1800.

Therefore, John spends $600 + $1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400 on everything.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Total cost for wooden tables = 4 tables * $20 per table = $<<4*20=80>>80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:

- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Total cost for roof frames = 2 roof frames * $10 per roof frame = $<<2*10=20>>20.

Now, we add the total cost of the wooden tables and the total cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total amount = Total cost for wooden tables + Total cost for roof frames
- Total amount = $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \boxed{100}.

Next, we calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:

Now, we need to determine how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:

The total length of the board is 40 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we multiply the length of the shorter piece by 4:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 \]

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

2. According to the problem, 9 novels is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:
   \[

3. To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
   \[
   9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x

   - Pasta: $1.00 per box
   - Cheddar cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere cheese: Twice the cost of cheddar cheese, so \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\)

   Total weekly cost:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. **Annual Cost Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Weekly cost is $10.00

   Total annual cost:
   \[
   10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
   \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}
\]

answer:  To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

Since each issue is part of a magazine, we need to convert the total number of issues into whole magazines:
\[
66 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ magazines}
\]

Therefore, Susan receives \(\boxed{66}\) magazines every year.

First, add all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60

Let's add them step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, divide this sum by the number of quizzes (which is 9):

answer:  To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of pomelos Eve had.
2. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve has left after giving some away.
3. Subtract the number of pomelos left from the initial number of pomelos to find out how many she gave away.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Eve initially had 20 pomelos.
2. After giving some away, she is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her original pomelos. Therefore, the number of pomelos she has left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   So, Eve has 5 pomelos left.
3. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos left from the initial number of pomelos:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he travels for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so he travels for a total of:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The distance Michael has traveled is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2.

For the first 5 years:
3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30

Next, let's calculate the cost of the visits for the next 3 years at the increased price:

The cost of one visit increased by 150%, so the new cost per visit is:
$2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5

For the next 3 years:
3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45

Finally, let's add the costs from both periods to find the total amount spent:

Total cost = Cost for the first 5 years + Cost for the next 3 years
Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum.

answer:  First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:
- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:
- Capacity of one bookcase = 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
- Number of bookcases needed = 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Next, let's convert the total time spent cleaning into hours:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's determine the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms:
\[ \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{40 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, on average, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

1. Calculate the total amount of ground beef needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Determine the amount of seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, let's find out how much ground beef is needed to make 80 meatballs. Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs per pound of ground beef, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Amount of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, we multiply the amount of ground beef by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of one phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \).

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones. The cost of the main phone is given as $20, so the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ 20 + 4x = 5x \]

To find the cost of one phone, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, each additional phone costs $4. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, which is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is:

\[ 20 + 4 \times 4 = 20 + 16 = 36 \]

So, the whole phone plan costs $36.

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies she made is \( 3C - 2 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is \( C + (3C - 2) = 4C - 2 \).

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

To find \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 10 + 2 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum these times.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we sum the times for all the sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

\( \boxed{30} \)

answer:  To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to calculate the number of helmets, robots, and footballs based on the given relationships.

1. **Number of helmets:**
   Dominick saw 20 helmets.

2. **Number of robots:**
   Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Number of footballs:**
   Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total number of items:**
   To find the total number of items, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs:
   \[
   \text{Total number of items} = 20 + 10 + 40 = 70
   \]

Therefore, Dominick saw a total of 70 items in the changing room.

answer:  First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds, so the total daily consumption is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) kilograms.

- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs, so the total daily consumption is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) kilograms.

Next, we add the daily consumption of the German Shepherds and Bulldogs to find the total daily consumption:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we need to find out how much dog food they consume in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the Kennel house will need \boxed{147} kilograms of dog food in a week.

answer:  First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of apples remaining after he ate some:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples left is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter sold these remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. Therefore, the total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Walter received $81 from his uncle.

The final answer is:

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Since there are 20 plants in total and 4 and 8 are already accounted for, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is:
20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for these 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Finally, let's add up all the water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

answer:  First, calculate the depreciation for the first year:
- Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700
- Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Next, calculate the depreciation for the second year:
- Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890
- Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Finally, calculate the depreciation for the third year:
- Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882
- Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years. The total depreciation is from $9000 to $3528 = $3528.

answer:  Phineas needs to travel a distance of 200 yards. Since half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water, the distance he travels on each mode is 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To find the time it takes for him to hop 100 yards, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to hop on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Phineas swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To find the time it takes for him to swim 100 yards, we use the same formula:

Time to swim through water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

To find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we add the time spent hopping on land and the time spent swimming through water:

Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

The final answer is 15 minutes.

1. Calculate the number of doughnuts Derrick sells per day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the doughnuts in June.

First, let's calculate the number of doughnuts Derrick sells per day:
- Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- 1 dozen = 12 doughnuts.
- Therefore, 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, let's determine the number of days in June:
- June has 30 days.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the doughnuts in June:
- Each doughnut is sold for $2.
- Total revenue = Number of doughnuts sold per day * Price per doughnut * Number of days in June
- Total revenue = 120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut * 30 days
- Total revenue = $7200

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June by selling all the doughnuts.

answer:  To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade took.
2. Determine how many photos she uploads each day.
3. Divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day to find the number of days required.

First, let's confirm the total number of photos Jade took:
Jade took 210 photos.

Next, we calculate how many photos she uploads each day:
- She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

So, the number of photos uploaded each day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos.

- She bought 5 dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen contains 12 eggs.
- Therefore, 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- She bought the eggs at $2.40 per dozen.
- Therefore, 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many 3-egg sets she can make from 60 eggs, we divide 60 eggs by 3 eggs/set = 20 sets.
- Therefore, 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00
- Profit = $8.00

So, Rose's profit will be $8.00.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 2-legged animals.
- Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the 4-legged animals:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 \text{ seeds} = 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, add the number of seeds from both types of sunflowers to find the total number of seeds:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 54 \text{ seeds} = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

answer:  First, determine how many minutes Tim spends answering phones each day. Since he spends 6 hours each day and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, calculate how many calls Tim deals with in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends each day by the time it takes to deal with one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week. Multiply the number of calls he deals with each day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

answer:  To determine the force needed to move the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

The weight of the car is 1200 pounds.
The weight of the luggage is 250 pounds.
The weight of the two children is 75 pounds each, so the total weight of the children is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) pounds.

Adding these together, the total weight is:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 1600 = \frac{1}{100} \times 1600 = 0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force needed to push the car is:
\[ \boxed{16} \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. He gets a buy one get one 50% off deal, which means he only pays for one T-shirt.

The discounted price of one T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \]

Since Jake only pays for one T-shirt, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
\[ 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]

The discounted price of the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Now, let's add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

1. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks. Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks per box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - So, the number of children becomes \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - So, the number of children becomes \(10 \times 3 = 30\).

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**

answer:  Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of his collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, let's determine how many toy soldiers are in each group:
- Half of 12 toy soldiers is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.
- The other half is also 6 toy soldiers.

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each group:
- For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 per toy): \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) dollars.
- For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 per toy): \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the earnings from both groups to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 (from the first half) + $42 (from the second half) = $72.

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $72.

1. Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
2. 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
3. Therefore, for 4 gallons:
   \[
   4 \text{ gallons} \times 6 \text{ lemons/gallon} = 24 \text{ lemons}
   \]

Next, let's consider the extra gallon of lemonade for Allen, which is twice as tart as the other gallons:

1. Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
2. Therefore, for the extra gallon:
   \[
   2 \text{ gallons} \times 6 \text{ lemons/gallon} = 12 \text{ lemons}
   \]

Finally, we add the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:

\[
24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons}

- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point:
- Distance = √((Distance west)^2 + (Distance east)^2)
- Distance = √(90^2 + 144^2)
- Distance = √(8100 + 20736)
- Distance = √28836

- He gathered 8 test tubes.
- He gathered 16 Petri dishes.

Adding these together, the total number of items is:

- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for 2 people, so $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spending = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Next, let's find out how much money Janet has left after spending:

- Amount given by parents: $40
- Total spending: $27.00

Amount left = $40 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

answer:  To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings for 2 weeks.

1. There are 7 days in a week.
2. Josh is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open for 5 days in a week.
3. He services 3 cars each day, so in a week, he services 5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars.
4. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are 15 cars * $4/car = $60.
5. For 2 weeks, his earnings are $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine the current ages of James and Dora.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.
2. James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, let's determine John's current age.

1. John had James when he was 19, so James is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.
2. Therefore, John is \(37 - 19 = 18\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current age of John's youngest son.

1. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is \(32 - 18 = 4\) years old.

Finally, let's determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

1. If the youngest son is currently 4 years old, then in 3 years he will be \(4 + 3 = 7\) years old.

answer:  To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.

First, let's find the average enrollment at Butler High School:

Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School.

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than Butler High School.

answer:  Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so he digs a total of 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, so he can fill in 9 * 7 = 63 holes in a week.

However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so he digs 6 * 7 = 42 new holes in a week.

To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the net number of holes he fills in each week.

Net holes per week = Holes filled in by Nate - Holes dug by the dog
Net holes per week = 63 - 42 = 21 holes per week

To find out how many weeks it takes to fill in all 84 holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per week.

Number of weeks = Total holes / Net holes per week
Number of weeks = 84 / 21 = 4 weeks

answer:  To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of meals Mamou has already given out.
2. Subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals she needs to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
- On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
- On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Adding these together:
\[ 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 \]

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the number of meals given out from the total number of meals she needs to distribute:
- She needs to distribute 1,360 meals.
- She has given out 142 meals.

Subtracting:
\[ 1360 - 142 = 1218 \]

Therefore, Mamou has 1218 meals left to distribute.

1. Calculate the total number of screws needed for the 4 tables.
2. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.

First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is \(4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table}\).
- Since there are 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is \(8 \text{ screws/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

Next, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has:
- James has 40 screws.
- He needs 32 screws.
- Therefore, the number of screws left over is \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

answer:  To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue per reservation.
2. Multiply the daily revenue by the number of reservations per night.
3. Multiply the daily revenue by the number of nights the restaurant is open per week.

First, let's calculate the total revenue per reservation:
- Each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.
- Each reservation also includes a bottle of wine for $5.
- Therefore, the total revenue per reservation is \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue:
- There are 6 reservations per night.
- So, the daily revenue is \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly revenue:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- So, the weekly revenue is \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) dollars.

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week.

answer:  To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required.
2. Subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total amount required.

First, let's calculate the total amount of line required:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There is 200 feet of dock.

So, the total amount of line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total amount required:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line required} - 6 \text{ feet of line he has} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy **594 feet** of line.

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Next, calculate the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 jars * $44/jar = $440

Then, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
- Total revenue = 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

answer:  Let \( C \) be the number of chickens and \( K \) be the number of cows.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now, substitute \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
