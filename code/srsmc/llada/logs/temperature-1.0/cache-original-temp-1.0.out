answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the distance James runs in one day.
3. Calculate the distance James runs in one week.

First, let's calculate the distance James runs in one sprint:
- James runs 60 meters per sprint.

Next, let's calculate the distance James runs in one day:
- James runs 3 sprints each day.
- Therefore, in one day, he runs \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) meters.

Finally, let's calculate the distance James runs in one week:
- James runs 3 times a week.
- Therefore, in one week, he runs \( 3 \times 180 = 540 \) meters.

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.

answer:  To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs she eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends.
3. Determine the number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she eats a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.
3. The number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs she eats, which is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs per day.
4. Janet sells each egg for $2, so the total revenue from selling 9 eggs per day is 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  To find the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

The amount of blue fiber is 2 bolts.
The amount of white fiber is half of the blue fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is:
2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost Josh incurred:

- Initial cost of the house: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000

Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Next, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs:

- Initial value of the house: $80,000
- Increase in value: 150%

Increase in value = $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000

New value of the house = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = New value of the house - Total cost

Profit = $200,000 - $130,000

Profit = $70,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

- Total file: 200 GB
- 40% of the file: 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
- Download speed: 2 GB/minute

Time to download the first 40% = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

- Remaining file: 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB
- Download speed: 2 GB/minute

Time to download the remaining 60% = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the restart:

- Time for restart: 20 minutes

Total time = 40 minutes (first 40%) + 60 minutes (remaining 60%) + 20 minutes (restart) = 120 minutes

answer:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she needs to feed all her chickens in a day.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens in her flock. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed in a day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals:
- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

Adding these together gives:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

answer:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost for each type of glass and then sum them up.

1. The cost of one glass is $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass, which is 0.60 * $5 = $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so he will have 8 regular glasses and 8 discounted glasses.

Let's calculate the total cost:

- The cost for 8 regular glasses is:   \[
  8 \times 5 = 40
  \]

- The cost for 8 discounted glasses is:
  \[
  8 \times 3 = 24
  \]

Now, we add the cost of the regular glasses and the discounted glasses to find the total cost:
\[
40 + 24 = 64
\]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

The final answer within \boxed{}:
\[
\boxed{64}

answer:  To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to calculate the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep from all three cities:
\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Seattle's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Toulouse's sheep}
\]
\[
\text{Total sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep they have is 260.

answer:  To find the total cost of Toula's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen: $68
   - Total cost for donuts: \( 3 \times 68 = $204 \)

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen: $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \( 2 \times 80 = $160 \)

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen: $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \( 6 \times 55 = $330 \)

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Toula's purchase is $694.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the first part of his trip:

- He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Next, let's consider the distance he traveled during the second part of his trip:

- He drove for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
- Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

Then, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the third part of his trip:

- He drove for the remaining 1 hour at 80 mph.
- Distance = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances:

- Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 80 miles = 275 miles.

Since John turned around after traveling 275 miles, he is 275 miles away from his starting point.

Therefore, John is 275 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

answer:  Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour, so her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $<<40*10=400>>400.
She works the remaining 5 hours at her overtime rate, which is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12 per hour.
Her earnings for the overtime hours are 5 hours * $12/hour = $<<5*12=60>>60.
Therefore, her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460.

answer:  To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads: 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - Downloads: Three times the number of downloads in the first month
   - Downloads: \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \)

3. **Third Month:**
   - Downloads: Reduced by 30% from the second month
   - Downloads: \( 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 \)

Now, we sum up the downloads for all three months:

\[ \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month} + \text{Second Month} + \text{Third Month} \]
\[ \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 \]
\[ \text{Total Downloads} = 366 \]

Therefore, the program had a total of **366 downloads** over the three months.

answer:  To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option based on the specified market increase.

**Jewelry:**
- Initial price: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- Increase in value: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
- New price: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

**Electronic gadgets:**
- Initial price: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- Increase in value: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
- New price: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125

answer:  To determine how many years it will take Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then determine when the total profit will cover the initial investment.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year:

1. **Revenue from selling lemons:**
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   - Carlos grows 7 lemons per year.
   - Revenue per year = 7 lemons * $1.5{lemmon = $10.50.

2. **Cost to water and feed the tree:**
   - Costs $3 per year.

3. **Net profit per year:**
   - Net profit per year = Revenue per year - Cost per year
   - Net profit per year = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Next, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial investment of $90:

- Number of years = Initial investment / Net profit per year
- Number of years = $90 / $7.50
- Number of years = 12

   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{6} = 5 + 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{6} = 6
   \]
   \[

- 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.

Next, let's find the number of students remaining after analyzing for contemporary dance:
- 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Now, let's find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
- 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Finally, let's determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
- The rest of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.
- 20 students - 4 students (contemporary) - 4 students (jazz) = 8 students (hip-hop).

Now, let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
- (8 students (hip-hop) / 20 students (total)) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%.

Thus, 40% of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

- Time to walk the first 4 miles: 1 hour
- Time to walk the next 2 miles: 1 hour
- Total time spent: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Next, calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to cover:
- Total distance: 12 miles
- Distance already walked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
- Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Now, determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
- Average speed: 4 miles per hour
- Total time spent: 2 hours
- Remaining time: 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours

Since the remaining time is 0 hours, it means Marissa has no time left to walk the remaining distance. Therefore, she needs to walk the entire 6 miles in 0 hours, which is an impossible situation.

Thus, Marissa cannot achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail with the given conditions.

- Amount of water = 10 liters * 2/3 = 6 liters of water.

For the pineapple drink:
- 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water.
- Amount of water = 15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters of water.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water before the spill:

answer:  To find the original price of the book, we need to reverse the 25% discount. Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

1. **Determine the relationship between the original price and the discounted price:**
   - A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.
   - Therefore, the discounted price is \( 0.75P \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - We know the discounted price is $19.50.
   - So, \( 0.75P = 19.50 \).

3. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
     \[
     P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
     \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   - Calculate the value:
     \[
     P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26

2. The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend says 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend says 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 (first friend) + 60 (second friend) + 100 (third friend) = 240 jelly beans.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of friends:

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, the total cost of the high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 99 + 5 = B \]
\[ 104 = B \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars.

\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:

\[ \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's calculate the points he scores in the second 20 minutes:
- 25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.
- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points:
- Points in the first 20 minutes: 4 points
- Points in the second 20 minutes: 5 points

Total points: \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation:

\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

\[

answer:  To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Raymond's Jewels:**
   Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Aaron's Jewels:**
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels: \( 20 + 5 = 25 \)
   - Therefore, Aaron has 25 jewels.

3. **Siobhan's Jewels:**
   Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - 2 fewer than Aaron's jewels: \( 25 - 2 = 23 \)
   - Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

answer:  If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
If Dana spends one-third of the time running, she runs for (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours.
If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she walks for (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours.
In six hours, she covers 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles running and 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles walking.
Therefore, Dana can travel 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles in six hours.

answer:  John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, so he started with:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he earned $195 from selling his lego sets and started with $165, he must have spent:
\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he spent $30 on the video games, so he must have spent:
\[ 30 - 30 = 0 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, he did not spend any money on the lego sets, and he still has all 13 lego sets because he did not sell any.

John still has 13 lego sets.

answer:  To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.
- Therefore, he runs for \( 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \) hours on the other two days.

Adding these together, the total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

answer:  First, let's determine how many calories are in one serving of chips. Since a 300g bag has 5 servings and each serving contains 250 calories, we can calculate the total calories in the bag:

Total calories per bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can consume within your daily calorie target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories are:

Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can calculate how many servings you can eat without exceeding 200 calories:

Remaining servings = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, the number of grams you can eat is:

Remaining grams = 0.8 servings * 300g/serving = 240g

The answer is 240 grams.

1. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
3. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Let's denote the age of Suzy's iPhone as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 1 \) year.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate the age of Ben's iPhone as follows:
\[ \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times S = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone as follows:
\[ \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

1. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.
3. The dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet. So, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames.

Therefore, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. Therefore, the cost of one red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of all ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

2. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

1. **Total Revenue:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - Total revenue for 20 candles = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00.

2. **Total Cost of Supplies:**
   - One pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00.
   - For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (since 20 candles / 10 candles/pound = 2 pounds).
   - Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00.

3. **Net Profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

answer:  On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Each article takes 4 hours to write, so she spent 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. Since 2/5 times 5 is 2, she wrote 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 articles on Tuesday. Therefore, she spent 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles on Wednesday. Therefore, she spent 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 hours on Wednesday.

To find the total number of hours she spent writing articles over the three days, we add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = <<20+28+56=104>>104 hours.

2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially from the total number of Post-it notes she purchased to find out how many were in the package.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes she used:
- She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
- She also had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had is:

- She initially had 80 Post-it notes.
- She purchased a total of 243 Post-it notes.

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we add the time it took to sail away and the time it takes to sail back to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \, \text{hours} + 5 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{hours} \]

2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's find the total number of units in the building:
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units:
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Occupied units = (3/4) * 120 units = 90 units.

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week:
- The chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total eggs per week = 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs.

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens per week = 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 142 dozens.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2.
- Total revenue per week = 142 dozens * $2/dozen = $284.

answer:  The first half of the year consists of 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months.

For the first half of the year, Aleena pays $140 per month:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$140 \text{ per month} = \$840 \]

For the second half of the year, Aleena pays 10% less per month. To find the reduced amount, we calculate:
\[ \$140 - (0.10 \times \$140) = \$140 - \$14 = \$126 \]

So, for the second half of the year, she pays $126 per month:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$126 \text{ per month} = \$756 \]

To find the total amount paid by the end of the year, we add the amounts from both halves of the year:
\[ \$840 + \$756 = \$1596 \]

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of \$1596 by the end of the year.

answer:  To determine the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

1. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.
2. **Unripe oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe, so we calculate 20% of 25.
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.
3. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good:
\[
1 + 5 + 2 = 8
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[
25 - 8 = 17
\]

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.

answer:  To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate the initial pension amount for the first 20 years and then apply the 5% coverage for the remaining 10 years.

1. **Initial pension for the first 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

2. **Pension for the remaining 10 years:**
   - After 20 years, Marcy is entitled to 5% of the initial pension amount per year.
   - 5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500 per year.
   - Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this amount for the remaining 10 years.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension for the remaining 10 years will be $2,500 per year.

So, Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years will be $2,500 per year.

answer:  To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

4. **Total number of gems:**
   - Add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
     \[
     175 + 140 + 280 = 595
     \]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[

answer:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of gas she used to travel 100 miles.
2. Determine the total amount of gas in the tank.
3. Calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank.

First, we know that Sophia used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. To find out how much gas she uses per mile, we divide the amount of gas by the distance traveled:

\[ \text{Gas per mile} = \frac{4 \text{ gallons}}{100 \text{ miles}} = 0.04 \text{ gallons per mile} \]

Next, we know her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we divide the total gas in the tank by the gas used per mile:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = \frac{12 \text{ gallons}}{0.04 \text{ gallons per mile}} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week:

1. Jim does this 3 times a week.

So, in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:

\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people sent by one school:

1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also has a coach for each team.

So, the total number of people sent by one school is:
- 1 girls' team
- 1 boys' team
- 5 players on each team
- 1 coach for each team

This gives us:
- 1 girls' team
- 1 boys' team
- 5 players per team * 2 teams = 10 players
- 1 coach per team * 2 teams = 2 coaches

Adding these together:
- 1 girls' team + 1 boys' team + 10 players + 2 coaches = 14 people per school

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all schools is:
- 14 people per school * 4 schools = 56 people

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools to the basketball tournament is 56.

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of students at the school:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

We are given that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

answer:  To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. The second level has half the square footage of the top level, so it has \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
3. The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it has \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
4. The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

Now, we sum the square footage of all four levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

The average square footage of a level is the total square footage divided by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- Revenue from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $<<23*4=92>>92

Now, we add the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:
- Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
- Total revenue = $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221.

answer:  Let's denote the number of games the football team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the football team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 games. 

To present the answer as requested in the original format:

The football team won 15 games.

answer:  To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacations he goes on each year.
3. Calculate the total number of vacations over the years.
4. Each vacation corresponds to a quilt block, so the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

First, let's calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:
- Gene is currently 34 years old.
- He has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
- Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Next, let's determine the number of vacations he goes on each year:
- Gene goes on 4 vacations per year.

Now, let's calculate the total number of vacations over the years:
- Total number of vacations = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
- Total number of vacations = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Therefore, the number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44.

answer:  To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each occurrence and then sum them up.

1. **First occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first occurrence.
   - Since the first occurrence lasted 4 rings, the second occurrence lasted \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) rings.

3. **Third occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second occurrence.
   - Since the second occurrence lasted 12 rings, the third occurrence lasted \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) rings.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three occurrences:

- First occurrence: 4 rings
- Second occurrence: 12 rings
- Third occurrence: 6 rings

Total rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

1. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   - Cindy has 4 pets.
   - Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   - Number of pets Marcia has = 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Number of pets Jan has = 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Number of pets Cindy has = 4 pets.
   - Number of pets Marcia has = 6 pets.
   - Number of pets Jan has = 18 pets.
   - Total number of pets = Number of pets Cindy has + Number of pets Marcia has + Number of pets Jan has.
   - Total number of pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

Therefore, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have is 28.

answer:  Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn's and Harald's records is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the number of copies sold by Harald, divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Calculate the division:

\[ H = 7,909.09 \]

Since the number of copies sold must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number:

\[ H \approx 7,909 \]

Therefore, Harald sold approximately 7,909 copies.

\[ \text{Number of guests who don't show up} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who will show up is:

\[ \text{Number of guests who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags Christina will need. She needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest.

\[ \text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

2. Calculate how many hours James slept.
3. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

First, we know that Harry slept 9 hours.

Next, we know that James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. So, we calculate the number of hours James slept as follows:

1. Calculate the initial volume of the tomatoes.
2. Determine the number of cans needed.
3. Calculate the total number of tomatoes used.

\[ \text{Initial volume of tomatoes} = 2 \times 32 \text{ ounces} = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cans were used. Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Finally, each can contains 3 tomatoes:

\[ \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( 30 - x \).

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the second 15 minutes is \( (30 - x) + 20 = 50 - x \).

After the traffic jam, 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( (50 - x) - 5 = 45 - x \).

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45 - x = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages

Remaining pages to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Remaining pages to read / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

answer:  First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

answer:  First, we need to determine how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water the boat took on is:

answer:  Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry intended to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to make \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he ended up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the gas after applying the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback reward.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas without any cashback:
- The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
- The customer buys 10 gallons.
- Total cost without cashback = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Next, let's calculate the total cashback reward:
- The cashback rate is $0.20 per gallon.
- The customer buys 10 gallons.
- Total cashback = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:
- Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

answer:  To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

Beatrice's roll-ups:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups

Total roll-ups Beatrice ate = 2 roll-ups * 24 roll-ups = 48 roll-ups

Marcell's roll-ups:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups

Total roll-ups Marcell ate = 3 roll-ups * 14 roll-ups = 42 roll-ups

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups
Total roll-ups = 48 roll-ups + 42 roll-ups = 90 roll-ups

Finally, we calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten:
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / Number of people
Average roll-ups = 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups

So, they ate an average of 45 roll-ups.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards, each costing $10.
- Total cost = 10 * $10 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards, each costing $16.
- Total cost = 5 * $16 = $80.

Now, let's find the total cost of all the boards:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have increased by 50%, the new price of each board is:
- New price per board = $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Total revenue = 15 * $15 = $225.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = $225 - $180 = $45.

1. There are 4 teachers.
2. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons per day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ times per lesson} = 24 \text{ times per day} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \).

According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( 6B = 1800 \) photographs.

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

According to the problem:
\[ B = 50D \]
\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo can show 6 birds.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]

answer:  Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can write:
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30000 \]

So, Lylah earned $30,000 four years ago.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Lylah's salary remains the same, so she still earns $30,000.

answer:  To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

Next, we know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. This means the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water can be divided into 20 parts.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of parts by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, each part of the ratio represents 6 teaspoons of sugar.

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply the value of one part by 7 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

1. Calculate the number of vehicles in the initial 2 containers.
2. Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day.

First, let's calculate the number of vehicles in the initial 2 containers:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles after the second day became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

answer:  To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

1. **Distance in the first 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Distance in the remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the next 4 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. **Total distance run in 7 hours:**
   - Total distance = Distance in the first 3 hours + Distance in the remaining 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year:
- Each car wash costs $15.
- Tom gets 48 car washes in a year.

So, the total cost in a year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

answer:  To determine the number of pink gumballs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of blue gumballs.
2. Calculate the number of pink gumballs based on the given relationship.

Given:
- There are 12 blue gumballs.
- The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem:
\[ P = 4 \times (\text{4 blue gumballs}) + 22 \]

Substitute the number of blue gumballs into the equation:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Calculate the multiplication:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, add 22 to 48:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]

answer:  To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
- He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Total questions completed = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
- He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Total questions completed = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark left incomplete on each test:
- For the first test: 75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions.
- For the second test: 100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions.

Therefore, Mark left 35 questions on the first test and 70 questions on the second test.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we need to calculate the 10% tax on the total cost:

Tax amount = $15 * 10% = $15 * 0.10 = $1.50

Finally, we add the tax amount to the total cost before tax to find the total cost:

Total cost including tax = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

So, the total cost of everything, including tax, is $16.50.

answer:  Let's denote the number of queen bees as \( Q \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).

There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know the total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queen bees.

The number of baby bees is \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \).

The number of worker bees is \( 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

\[ 30 \text{ bees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bees that return in the first 6 hours:

Then, we calculate the number of bees that leave the hive in the next 6 hours:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees} \]

Every bee that left in the first 6 hours and hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours minus the number of bees that returned in the first 6 hours:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ bees} \]

Thus, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. To find the number of pieces in the second set, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
   So, the second set has 1500 pieces.
3. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces in the first set. To find the number of pieces in the third set, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125
   \]
   So, the third set has 125 pieces.

Now, we sum the pieces from all three sets:

1. Find out how many friends Dorothy has.
2. Determine how many friends James has based on Dorothy's friends.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 12 \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find James's number of friends, we multiply her number of friends by 4:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, find the difference in time between the two:
- Difference in time: Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Since the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house until the loser (Tim) finishes, we need to subtract the difference in time from Tim's time:
- Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, Steve will be waiting at his house for an additional 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

answer:  To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the depth of the water on Monday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the depth on Monday.
3. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday by taking two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

answer:  To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish they caught and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of fish Locsin caught:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) starfish.
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) sea horses.
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by both:
- Anakin's total: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish
- Locsin's total: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Total together: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

answer:  To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and apply it accordingly.

First, let's calculate the price increase every two months:
- Original price: $20
- Increase: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
- New price after two months: $20 + $4 = $24

Now, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
- 36 months / 2 months per interval = 18 intervals

Since the price increases by 20% every two months, we need to calculate the price after 18 intervals:
- Original price: $20
- Increase: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
- New price after two months: $20 + $4 = $24

After 18 intervals:
- Original price after 18 intervals: $24

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be $24.

answer:  Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

answer:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the lost income from doing taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the lost income from doing the taxes herself:
- Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour.

So, the lost income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35 \text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, let's consider the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, we need to find the difference between the lost income and the cost of hiring the accountant:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more than if she does the taxes herself.

answer:  To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of her computer and accessories.
2. Subtract the total cost from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the computer and accessories:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's do the addition:

€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

So, the total cost of the computer and accessories is €1423.

Next, we subtract the total cost from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 Spanish flans.
2. Determine how many eggs Sandra gets from her neighbor each time she babysits.
3. Calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get enough eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs needed:
- Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs.
- Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans.
- Total eggs needed = 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs.

Next, let's determine how many eggs Sandra gets from her neighbor each time she babysits:
- Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits.

Now, let's calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs:
- Total eggs needed = 45 eggs.
- Eggs per babysit = 9 eggs.
- Number of babysits needed = 45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysit = 5 babysits.

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

answer:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking distance into weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the distance he walks on weekdays:
- Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- So, the total distance walked on weekdays is 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance he walks on weekends:
- Pancho walks 10 miles a day on weekends.
- There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
- So, the total distance walked on weekends is 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

Now, we add the distances walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total distance walked in a week:
- Total distance walked in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekends) = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. First, we find the total cost of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   25 + 75 = 100
   \]
   Then, we calculate the average:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
   So, the cost of the pants is $50.

Now, we sum up the costs of all three components to find the total cost of each uniform:

\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50 \text{ per glass} = \$10 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Given that they made $25 in profit, their total cost per gallon must be:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Revenue per gallon} - \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$10 - \$5 \]
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$5 \]

- Student loans: $300 + (50% of $300) = $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 + (50% of $200) = $200 + $100 = $200
- Mortgage: $500 + (50% of $500) = $500 + $250 = $750

Next, sum the increased monthly payments for all debts to find the total monthly payment:

- Total monthly payment = $450 + $200 + $750 = $1400

Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the total annual payment:

- Total annual payment = $1400 * 12 = $16800

\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, find the difference in probability:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33\% \]

So, it is 33% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
2. Calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna.
3. Add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother.

Given:
- Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
- Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

First, calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} + \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

They both picked 30 apples.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters and rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces

Next, let's find out how many pieces of straw are left for the rats:

- Total straw distributed = 160 pieces
- Straw for hamsters and rabbits = 70 pieces

Straw for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is:

- Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

The rats are kept in 3 cages with equal groups, so the number of rats in each cage is:

- Number of rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Determine the total amount of insects needed per day for ten ducks.
3. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.

First, let's calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks:
- One duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- Therefore, ten ducks need \(10 \times 3.5 = 35\) pounds of insects per week.

Next, let's determine the total amount of insects needed per day for ten ducks:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, ten ducks need \(35 \div 7 = 5\) pounds of insects per day.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck:
- Since ten ducks need 5 pounds per day, one duck needs \(5 \div 10 = 0.5\) pounds per day.

Therefore, each duck needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day.

answer:  Let's denote the number of bags of wheat sold as \( n \).

The trader buys each bag for $20 and costs $2 to transport each bag, so the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 30n - 22n = 8n \text{ dollars} \]

We know that the total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

\[ \text{Total tickets} = 3 \times \$20.25 = \$60.75 \]

Next, let's calculate the amount spent on food:
\[ \text{Food} = \$60.75 - \$4.50 = \$56.25 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66 \]

Now, let's add up all the individual costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$60.75 + \$56.25 + \$66 = \$183 \]

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly among the three friends, we divide the total amount spent by the number of friends:
\[ \text{Amount per friend} = \frac{\$183}{3} = \$61 \]

Therefore, each friend paid:

Given:
- Cost of a pencil = $1.20
- Cost of an eraser = $0.30

First, calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser:
\[ \text{Combined cost} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Combined cost} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Therefore, the cost of one pen is $1.50.

Next, calculate the total cost for 8 pens:
\[ \text{Total cost of 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times \text{Number of pens} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of 8 pens} = 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

answer:  To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trees the number of trees increases after 10 years.
2. Subtract the number of trees that die.

First, let's calculate the net change in the number of trees each year:
- Tom plants 10 trees per year.
- Tom chops down 2 trees per year.
- Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
- 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

Next, we need to account for the trees that die:
- 30% of the trees die.
- Number of trees that die = 30% * 80 trees = 24 trees.

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
- 80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 56 trees left.

answer:  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white. 
One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
So, they took back 6 pink flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out.

Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left after Saturday is:
\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]

At noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink plastic flamingos.

At the same time, there are 6 white plastic flamingos (since 6 were painted white and put back out on Saturday).

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons:
- Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
- Each crayon costs $2.

Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 crayons × $2 per crayon
Total cost = $10

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:
- Violetta has $20.

Change = Amount of money - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 in change.

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher} \]

Next, calculate the amount Mark earns from each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, and Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, which is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

Now, calculate the total earnings from each publisher:

- Earnings from Publisher A: \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents
- Earnings from Publisher B: \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents

Finally, add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \]
So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

Now, we add up all the cards she has collected:
\[ 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \]

Finally, we add the initial number of cards she had:
\[ 20 + 320 = 340 \]

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 340 Pokemon cards in total.

answer:  Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens. Then, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \).
Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

The total number of eggs produced by all the chickens each day is:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

First, distribute the 5 in the equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( r \):
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( r \):

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates cost:
\[ 6000 \times 6 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800, the cost of each cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{24} = 1450 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $1450.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and the shoes:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, so 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40.
- Total cost of the jacket and shoes = $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara has already saved:
- Sara already has $10 saved.

Now, let's calculate how much more money Sara needs:
- Total cost = $70
- Money saved = $10
- Money needed = $70 - $10 = $60

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
- Money earned from babysitting = 4 * $5 = $20

Sara needs an additional $60 - $20 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn:
- Number of times she needs to mow the lawn = $40 / $4 = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

answer:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

answer:  To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide that by his walking speed.

First, calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (1.5 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes for Gary to walk this perimeter at a speed of 3 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

1. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
2. Determine the total number of customers over the first two days.
3. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \( 100 + 50 = 150 \).
3. The total number of customers over the first two days is \( 100 + 150 = 250 \).
4. The total number of customers by the third day is 500. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is \( 500 - 250 = 250 \).

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \( \boxed{250} \).

answer:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons of water.

Since the pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water lost from each pool in 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

So, the amount of water remaining in the small pool now is \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water remaining in the big pool now is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x = 4x - 48 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, the small pool has \(24\) gallons of water now.

- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi's points: 68
- Yuri's points: 44
- Brianna's points: 85

Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo are:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + (0.10 \times 2000) \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's determine how much Janeth will pay in 12 months. She pays $165 per month.

\[ \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Total payment} = 1980 \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance after 12 months.

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total payment} \]

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

1. Harriet's current age: 21 years
2. Adrian's current age: 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years
3. Zack's current age: 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
2. Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years
3. Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years

To find the average age in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:

Total age in three years = 24 + 66 + 45 = 135 years
Average age in three years = 135 / 3 = 45 years

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 45 years.

First, calculate the number of petunias:
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 50 \]

Total cards after changes = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

Now, we need to find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:

Probability of picking a water type card = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
Probability of picking a water type card = (32 / 96) * 100
Probability of picking a water type card ≈ 33.33%

\[ \text{Number of students through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

Next, find the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Then, calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
\[ \text{Number of students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

Finally, find the number of students who went out through exit C:
\[ \text{Number of students through exit C} = 700 - (300 + 420) = 700 - 720 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{80}\).

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider both the pens he initially buys and the pens he can create by mixing ink from empty pens.

1. **Initial Pens:**
   - Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **New Pens from Ink:**
   - Ram can create one new pen from five empty pens.
   - If he buys 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
   - The number of new pens he can create from 25 empty pens is:
     \[
     \frac{25 \text{ empty pens}}{5 \text{ empty pens per pen}} = 5 \text{ new pens}
     \]

3. **Total Pens:**
   - Ram initially has 25 pens.
   - He creates 5 new pens from the ink.
   - Therefore, the total number of pens he gets to have is:
     \[
     25 \text{ initial pens} + 5 \text{ new pens} = 30 \text{ pens}
     \]

Thus, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.

answer:  To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we need to determine each girl's age and then add them up.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of the three girls:
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68
\]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68.

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he has used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

answer:  First, we need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies.

Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \). According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we need to determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{Number of candies James has} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The answer is 21.

2. Pandora has 1 book.

If they read each other's books in addition to their own:

- Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book.
- Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books.

So, the total number of books they will read is:

- Dolly: 2 books (her own) + 1 book (Pandora's) = 3 books
- Pandora: 1 book (her own) + 2 books (Dolly's) = 3 books

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read is:

answer:  First, determine the number of penpals Mike still writes to:
- He originally had 5 penpals.
- He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, he still writes to 5 - 2 = 3 penpals.

Next, calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week:
- Each penpal sends 2 letters a week.
- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, each penpal sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week.
- Since Mike writes to 3 penpals, he writes 3 * 10 = 30 pages per week.

Now, calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week:
- Mike writes 1 page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, he writes 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes per week.

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
4. After Billy took 10, Griffin had \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
5. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, so Griffin's total to \(9 + x\) fries.
6. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
7. After Colby took 2, Griffin had \(11 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
8. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so \(7 + x = 27\).

- Each day, it takes 6 hours to do the makeup.
- Each week, she needs it done 4 times.
- Each week, she needs 6 hours/day * 4 times/week = 24 hours/week.
- Over 5 weeks, she needs 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost without the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- For 120 hours, the total cost is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:

- The discount amount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.
- Therefore, the final amount Jean pays is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

\[ \text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 6200 \]

Next, determine the value of the pennies in the stack. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, the value in cents is:
\[ \text{Value in cents} = 6200 \]

Finally, convert the value from cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide the value in cents by 100:
\[ \text{Value in dollars} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is \(62 \text{ollars}\).

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees:

\[ \text{Time to heat up to 400 degrees} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.40 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to warm up the oil:

\[ \text{Time to cook} = 20 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add up all the times to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:

\[ \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 63 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the answer is 63 minutes.

answer:  To find the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined, we need to calculate the amount each girl has and then sum them up.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = \text{Carmen's money} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125
   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = \text{Samantha's money} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

Now, we add up the amounts of money each girl has:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 = 400

answer:  First, calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

Next, calculate the transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, subtract her budget from the total price of the house: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The answer is $9,500.

answer:  To find the total amount spent by the real estate agent, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5/ad * 50 ads = $<<5*50=250>>250

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.
- Total cost for television ads = $75/ad * 15 ads = $<<75*15=1125>>1125

Now, we add the total cost of the newspaper ads and the total cost of the television ads:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total $1375 on buying all the ads.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

answer:  To determine the change the cashier gives back, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount the mother paid.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount the mother paid:
Amount paid: $20.00
Total cost: $15.00

Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so it takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, let's calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The entire sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the number of stitches left for the sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes \boxed{315} stitches.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Now, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200.

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds. #### 3200

answer:  Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \), and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

- For 30 small holes, the time is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- For 15 large holes, the time is \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes to get the total time:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's calculate how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

answer:  To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. Therefore, the total weight of the flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that each delivery truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

answer:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

The car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles/hour. Therefore, the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles is:

\[ \text{Time for slow car} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

answer:  To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that together they have 10 times less medals than the total given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 17 medals.
- Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

According to the problem, together they have 10 times less medals than the total given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together.

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

answer:  On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total for the first day:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses from the first day: 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total for the second day:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises

To find the total count of the exercises done over the two days, we add the numbers from each day:

answer:  Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. During this time, she takes a break for half an hour (30 minutes) in the middle.

First, let's calculate the total time she spends working:
- Total hours = 3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes
- Break time = 30 minutes
- Total working time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Next, we need to determine how many 10-minute intervals Susan can work in 150 minutes:
- Number of 10-minute intervals = Total working time / 10 minutes
- Number of 10-minute intervals = 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval. Therefore, her total earnings are:
- Total earnings = Number of 10-minute intervals * Earnings per interval
- Total earnings = 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Thus, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

answer:  First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have more than 20 points:

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 18 + 1 = 19 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the total points of all three players:

Total points = 22 (Mike) + 19 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 84 points.

2. Calculate the number of oranges washed by the youngest son.
3. Determine the total number of oranges washed by both sons.
4. Subtract the total number of oranges washed from the original number of oranges to find the number of oranges left unwashed.

1. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
2. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he washes \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) oranges.
3. The total number of oranges washed by both sons is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) oranges.
4. Will originally had 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is \( 15 - 12 = 3 \) oranges.

- Distance to work: 30 miles
- Distance back home: 30 miles
- Total distance per day: 30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles

Next, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year:
- Number of days per week: 5
- Number of weeks per year: 50
- Total distance per year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven:

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Each person consumes 0.2 kg per meal, and they eat 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, each person consumes:

\[ 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \]

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

\[ 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \times 5 \text{ people} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = \frac{42}{2} \div 7 = 21 \div 7 = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

answer:  To determine by how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold on the days he was open:
- Weekend: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's sum these up:
\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \]
\[ 35 + 12 = 47 \]
\[ 47 + 18 = 65 \]

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out by how many crates he was off, we subtract the number of crates sold from the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

answer:  To determine how much money Carmen spends on the desk, we need to follow the sequence of bids.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each bid increases by $50.
3. Three other people each bid once, so they bid a total of 3 times.
4. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 4 times.

Let's calculate the bids step by step:

- Opening bid: $200
- First bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350
- Fourth bid: $350 + $50 = $400
- Fifth bid: $400 + $50 = $450
- Sixth bid: $450 + $50 = $500

Carmen wins after the sixth bid, which is $500.

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $500.

1. Calculate the number of books she sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books she sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the total earnings from the second year.

First, we know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books} \]

Next, we know the total number of books is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:

$6000 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1250 (flight ticket) = $7400

Theo wishes to save $2000 for his trip, so he has:
$7400 - $2000 = $5400

Therefore, Theo has $5400 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) people
- She invited 3 families with 4 people each: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) people

Total invited people: \( 12 + 12 = 24 \) people

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness: \( 8 \) people
- 1/4 of the number of people due to illness had previous commitments: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people

Total people who couldn't come: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of invited people to find out how many people showed up:

Total people who showed up: \( 24 - 10 = 14 \) people

So, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is 14.

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, let's find Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, we find Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

answer:  First, let's determine Noah's current age. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, and Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we calculate:

\[ \text{Noah's age six years ago} = \frac{46}{2} = 23 \]

So, Noah was 23 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah's current age is:

\[ \text{Noah's current age} = 23 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was:

\[ \text{Population six years ago} = 3000 \times 29 = 87000 \]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is:

\[ \text{Current population} = 87000 \times 2 = 174000 \]

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 174,000.

answer:  Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{6D}{2} = 105 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 6D = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ D = \frac{210}{6} = 35 \]

Therefore, there are 35 players on the defense.

answer:  Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we need to find the number of electric poles if the total number of electric wires required is 45.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as \( P \) and the number of electric wires as \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:

\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

This implies:

\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \]

We are given that the total number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. Therefore, we can substitute \( W = 45 \) into the equation:

\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

Calculate the number of marbles his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles} \]

Now, add the marbles he bought from Johanna and the marbles his father gave him:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, add these marbles to the original 50 marbles in the store:
\[ 50 + 28 = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of all the marbles, multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg per marble} = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

answer:  To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool:
- The dimensions of the pool are 6 feet by 4 feet by 5 feet.
- The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
  \[
  V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
  \]
  Substituting the given dimensions:
  \[
  V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet}
  \]

Next, we calculate the cost to fill the pool:
- The cost per cubic foot is $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
  \[
  C = 120 \times 0.10 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of adding cream.

1. **Cooling effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - If the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, the number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \).
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee 5 \times 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

2. **Weakening effect of adding cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - Any added liquid weakens the coffee, so 15 milliliters of cream will also weaknesses the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect from the ice cubes and the weakening effect from the cream:

Total weakening = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

The number of people remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's determine how many women left.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, and after some people left, there are 30 people remaining. If 22 men stayed, then the number of women who stayed is 30 - 22 = 8.

Thus, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

1. Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record.
2. There are 5 people.
3. They leave with 7 new records between them.

First, let's determine how many new records they received:
- Each person receives 1 new record.
- There are 5 people.

So, the total number of new records received is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ new record per person} = 5 \text{ new records} \]

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, we can calculate the total number of old records brought in:
- Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record.
- There are 5 people.

So, the total number of old records brought in is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ old records per person} = 10 \text{ old records} \]

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became:
\[ x + 5 \]

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

answer:  First, find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:

\[ \text{Hot dogs Thomas ate} = 3 \times \text{Hot dogs Luke ate} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{Hot dogs John ate} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Hot dogs Thomas ate} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, calculate how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Hot dogs John ate} - \text{Hot dogs Luke ate} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

answer:  To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new distance Tyson needs to run each day after his coach's advice.
2. Multiply the new distance by the number of days in June.

First, let's find the new daily distance:
- Tyson normally runs 5000 meters every day.
- His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more.
- Converting 1/5 times more to a distance increase: \( 1/5 \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- Therefore, the new daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, let's calculate the total distance for June:
- June has 30 days.
- Tyson runs 6000 meters every day.
- Therefore, the total distance for June is \( 6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \) meters.

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is \( \boxed{180,000} \) meters.

answer:  To determine how many balls Josh starts with at the talent show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of balls Josh was juggling at the end of the fourth week.
2. Account for the balls that were lost during the talent show.

First, let's calculate the number of balls Josh was juggling at the end of the fourth week:
- Josh starts with 3 balls.
- He adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks.
- Therefore, at the end of the fourth week, he is juggling \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

Next, let's account for the balls that were lost during the talent show:
- Josh drops 3 balls.
- 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd.
- 1 ball is lost completely.

So, the number of balls lost is \(3 - 2 = 1\) ball.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh starts with at the talent show is:
\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 1 \text{ ball} = 6 \text{ balls} \]

Thus, Josh starts on stage with 6 balls.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

answer:  To find the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs:
- There are 40 tables with 4 legs.
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Total legs from these tables = 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
- There are 50 tables with 3 legs.
- Each table has 3 legs.
- Total legs from these tables = 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
- Total legs = Legs from tables with 4 legs + Legs from tables with 3 legs
- Total legs = 160 legs + 150 legs
- Total legs = 310 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310 legs.

She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so:

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the cookies given to her son and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

First, let's find the height of the second tree:
- The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
- The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree.
- Therefore, the height of the second tree is \(6 + 5 = 11\) feet.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it needs to travel by the distance it travels in one day:
18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

answer:  First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The average amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed is:
\[ \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

For 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark needs a total of 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of customers kicked out for each reason:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number for refusing to wear masks minus 5:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
3. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for these specific reasons:
\[
3 + 7 + 21 = 31
\]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the specific reasons from the total number of people kicked out:
\[
50 - 31 = 19
\]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

answer:  To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fourth-grade boys.
2. Determine the number of fourth-grade boys absent on Friday.
3. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present.

First, let's find the total number of fourth-grade boys:
- Total number of fourth-graders = 96
- Number of fourth-grade girls = 43
- Number of fourth-grade boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of fourth-grade girls
- Number of fourth-grade boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Next, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday:
- Number of fourth-grade boys absent = 4

Now, subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present:
- Number of fourth-grade boys present = Number of fourth-grade boys - Number of fourth-grade boys absent
- Number of fourth-grade boys present = 53 - 4 = 49

So, the answer is 49.

answer:  To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then sum them up.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, they sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, they sold \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.
   - However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Now, we sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Thus, the store sold **50 tennis shoes** by the end of the sale.

answer:  To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of points Sara scored.
2. Calculate the number of points Erin has after scoring 14 points.
3. Determine the number of points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total.

1. Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, Erin's points after scoring 14 points are:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ points}
   \]
3. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current total:
   \[

44 seniors * $20 per picture frame = $880.

Next, calculate the additional cost for etching the picture frames:
44 seniors * 20% of $20 per picture frame = $44.

Now, add the cost of the etching to the cost of the picture frames:
$880 + $44 = $924.

Next, calculate the cost of the pins:
2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10.

Then, calculate the number of officers who will receive cords:
44 seniors * 1/4 = 11 officers.

Now, calculate the cost of the cords:
11 officers * $12 per cord = $132.

Finally, add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
$924 (picture frames and etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (ords) = $1066.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1066.

answer:  Let \( x \) be the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

After selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he had 12.8 hectares left. This can be expressed as:
\[ x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{5}{5}x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Calculate the product:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

- Number of boys = 52 * 0.50 = 26 boys
- Number of girls = 52 * 0.50 = 26 girls

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of girls performing is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls performing can't make it to the show:

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[11x = 165\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\)
- Sam's popsicles: \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\).

answer:  To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu, and then sum them up.

1. James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
2. James delivers \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

First, calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} \]
\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 \]
\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = 22 \]

Now, add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[ \text{Total messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} \]
\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

James delivers a total of 88 messages.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, for each ride, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \]

For 9 rides, the total cost is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David to buy a ride bracelet.

A ride bracelet costs $30 and covers 9 rides. Therefore, the cost for David to buy a ride bracelet is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, let's find out how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of ride tickets.

The total cost for Dasha to buy tickets is $36, and the cost for David to buy a ride bracelet is $30. The difference between the two is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets.

answer:  To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap.
2. Determine the total length of ribbon she has.
3. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Gifts for family: 6
- Gifts for friends: 4
- Gifts for teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Next, we know Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.

Now, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \text{Ribbon per gift} = \frac{\text{Total length of ribbon}}{\text{Total number of gifts}} \]
\[ \text{Ribbon per gift} = \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services before the discount:

- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu: $10 per month
- Disney Plus: $10 per month

Total cost before discount: $10 + $10 + $10 = $30 per month

Next, let's calculate the discount Tim gets due to bundling:

Discount: 20% of $30 = 0.20 * $30 = $6 per month

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services after the discount:

Total cost after discount: $30 - $6 = $24 per month

Finally, let's compare the total cost of the streaming services after the discount to the cost of the cable package:

- Cable package: $60 per month
- Streaming services after discount: $24 per month

Savings: $60 - $24 = $36 per month

Therefore, Tim saves $36 per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and opting for the streaming services instead. 

The answer is $36 per month.

answer:  First, calculate the total time spent on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: Half of 4 hours = 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
- Editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Next, find the total time spent on all activities:
- Total time = Writing + Recording + Editing
- Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
- Total time = 7.5 hours

Now, calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (1.5 * 100) / 7.5
- Percentage spent editing = 150 / 7.5
- Percentage spent editing ≈ 20%

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is approximately 20%.

answer:  Mark has $50 in his bank account and wants to buy a bike that costs $300. To find out how many days he needs to save, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount Mark needs to save.
2. Determine how much Mark earns per day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to save the remaining amount.

First, let's find the total amount Mark needs to save:
\[ \text{Total amount needed} = \text{Amount Mark wants} - \text{Amount he currently has} \]
\[ \text{Total amount needed} = 300 - 50 = 250 \]

Next, we know that Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save, we divide the total amount needed by his daily earnings:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total amount needed}}{\text{Daily earnings}} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{250}{10} = 25 \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: Nancy saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders.
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30

\[ 900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts} \]

If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy usage per day is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts} \]

The difference in energy usage per day is:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts} - 2700 \text{ watts} = 4500 \text{ watts} \]

To find the total energy savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts} \]

Therefore, Mel will save **13.5 kilowatts** of electric energy in 30 days.

answer:  Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs twice the amount of flour and four times the amount of milk as a normal batch.

For flour:
- A normal batch requires 3 cups of flour.
- For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour.
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk:
- A normal batch requires 1 cup of milk.
- For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk.
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- He needs 6 bags of flour.
- He needs 2 bottles of milk.

The difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk is:
6 - 2 = 4

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

- Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
- The number of corns is twice the number of cannolis, so he has \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) corns.

Next, let's account for the additional cannolis and corns Allan bought.

- Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has \( 40 + 60 = 100 \) cannolis.
- Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) more corns.

Now, let's calculate the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house.

- The total number of cannolis is 100.
- The total number of corns is \( 80 + 40 = 120 \).

- The total cost before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount:
- The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
- The total cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

answer:  In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

Employee's weekly pay = $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week

Total payment in May = 40 employees * $600/employee/week = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued to work.

Number of employees working in June = 3/4 * 40 employees = 30 employees

Employee's weekly pay = $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week

Total payment in June = 30 employees * $600/employee/week = $18,000

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the payments for May and June:

Total payment = $24,000 (May) + $18,000 (June) = $42,000

\[ 140 + x + 140 = 500 \]
\[ 280 + x = 500 \]

Subtracting 280 from both sides:

\[ x = 220 \]

So, Joanne gathered 220 apples from the average trees.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will consume in 30 days.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Therefore, in 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are required to make 60 cookies.

1 dozen equals 12 cookies, so:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \div 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

answer:  To determine how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are likely to explode.
2. Determine how many of these exploding candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's calculate the number of candles that are likely to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are likely to explode.

\[ \text{Number of candles likely to explode} = 50000 \times 0.01 = 500 \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these exploding candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect, we calculate 5% of the 500 candles.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

\[ \boxed{25} \]

answer:  To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount on each blouse.
2. Determine the discounted price of each blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

First, let's calculate the discount on each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

\[ \text{Discount} = 30\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.30 \times 20 = \$6 \]

Next, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount} = \$20 - \$6 = \$14 \]

Finally, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} = \$14 \times 4 = \$56 \]

answer:  To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver.

Step 1: Determine the elevation of Stanley's comb.
Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet away. Therefore, the elevation of Stanley's comb is:
\[ 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Step 2: Identify the elevation of Oliver.
Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver.
The difference in elevation is the elevation of Stanley's comb minus Oliver's elevation:
\[ 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( c \):
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, substitute \( c \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( d \):
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 304 = d \]
\[ 56 = d \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( d = 56 \).

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:

200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:

30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km

So, he traveled 240 km * 2 days = 480 km in the next two days.

On the next day, he didn't travel, so we add 0 km for that day.

For the second week, he traveled 300 km every day for 7 days:

300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up all the distances:

800 km + 480 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3380 km

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3380 kilometers during his two-week trip.

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker.

Let's denote the size of Zack's locker as \( Z \) cubic inches. According to the information given:
\[
5 = \frac{1}{4}Z
\]
Solving for \( Z \):
\[
Z = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the information given:
\[
Z = \frac{1}{2}T
\]
Substituting the value of \( Z \):
\[

answer:  First, let's determine the original costs of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans.

The tattered jeans cost $28.
The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

The amount saved on the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The amount saved on the tattered jeans is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Since the tattered jeans were on sale for $28, the original cost of the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 + 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the original cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost:
\[ 32 - 28 \] $4 more than the tattered jeans.

First, let's calculate the amount Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Finally, we add this total to Mr. Josue's initial capital:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

answer:  To calculate the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into three phases:

1. The first 6 months at $8 per month.
2. The next 8 months at $12 per month.
3. The last 6 months at $14 per month.

Let's calculate the cost for each phase:

1. First 6 months at $8 per month:
   - 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. Next 8 months at $12 per month:
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. Last 6 months at $14 per month:
   - 6 months * $14/month = $84

Now, let's add up the costs for all three phases:

$48 (first phase) + $96 (second phase) + $84 (third phase) = $228

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service is:

$228/year * 2 years = $456

answer:  Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells 1/3 of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{3}{3}x \]

Kenny has $50 left after buying the ticket, which costs $100. Therefore, the total amount of money he had before buying the ticket is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Since the total amount of money he made from selling his cards is $150, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{3}x = 150 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \times \frac{3}{3} \]
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ birds} \]

However, Lillian notices that the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each self-made feeder attracts:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds} \]

Lillian has 3 self-made feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by the self-made feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders is:
\[ 120 + 90 = 210 \text{ birds} \]

So Lillian can expect to see 210 birds in her garden each day.

However, the caterer prepared hotdogs for 36 guests, but 40 guests showed up. This means he actually had:

Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, and there were 4 extra hotdogs, the number of guests who got a second hotdog is:

answer:  To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight of each piece of cake.
2. Determine how many pieces are taken by Rory and her mom.
3. Subtract the weight of the taken pieces from the total weight of the cake.

1. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the weight of each piece is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
   \]

2. Rory and her mom each take one piece, so they take 2 pieces. The weight of these 2 pieces is:
   \[
   2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. Subtract the weight of the taken pieces from the total weight of the cake:
   \[
   20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

answer:  To determine how many oranges each person will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges bought by Sitti and Juris.
2. Determine the total number of people sharing the oranges.
3. Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get.

First, let's find the total number of oranges:
- Sitti bought 34 oranges.
- Juris bought 22 oranges.
- Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Next, let's determine the total number of people sharing the oranges:
- Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 friends.
- Total people = Sitti + Juris + 6 friends = 2 + 6 = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
- Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
- Oranges per person = 56 / 8 = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.

answer:  Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 pounds x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.
The cost of the onions is 4 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $8.00.
He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, so the cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00 per box = $4.00.
The total cost of the onions and beef stock is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.
The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.
The cost per serving is $2.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Jon took for the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have taken 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes
- Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so 80 + 5 = 85 minutes
- Run: We need to find this time

Total time for James = 36 + 85 + Run = 160 minutes

To find the run time, we subtract the swim and bike times from the total time:
Run = 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes

So, James took 39 minutes to do the run.

answer:  To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards = 3 * 3 feet = 9 feet (since 1 yard = 3 feet)

We can solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet.

For Elizabeth:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 beads + 40 beads = 60 beads

For Margareth:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 beads + 80 beads = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Elizabeth's total beads: 60 beads
- Margareth's total beads: 140 beads
- Difference: 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

answer:  To determine the house's final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature changes due to the baking and the window opening.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   - The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Effect:**
   - Marcus baked for 3 hours.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Therefore, after 3 hours, the temperature increases by \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.
   - Adding this to the initial temperature, the new temperature is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

3. **Window Opening Effect:**
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - In 30 minutes, the temperature decreases by \(30 \div 10 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.
   - Subtracting this from the current temperature, the final temperature is \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees.

So, the house's final temperature is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees.

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we calculate one-fourth of the length of Movie B:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the total distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.

1. Convert the distance from miles per hour to miles per minute:
   32 miles per hour = 32 miles / 60 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute

2. Calculate the total distance run in 30 minutes:
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 0.5 miles per minute * 30 minutes = 15 miles

Next, we need to determine how many bails of hay Michael needs. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail per mile:

Number of bails = 15 miles * (1/2) bail per mile = 7 bails

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay:

Total cost = 7 bails * $3 per Bail = $21

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

Therefore, the change Michael has after buying the hay is:

\[ 4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]
\[ 2 \text{ eggs} = 2 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make with 50 eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs.

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we can calculate the number of trays Rozanne can make by dividing the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray.

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

answer:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

When you buy the super ticket, you get one popcorn and one soda for $1 extra, so the total cost with the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

When you buy the movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and one soda at regular price, the total cost is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn with the soda at regular price should be $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 - 2 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 19 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

answer:  To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles.
2. Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:

- Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans per week, and each can is worth 2 cents.
  \[
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Grayson recycles 5 plastic bottles per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
  \[
  5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Total weekly earnings:
  \[
  6 + 15 = 21 \text{ cents}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:

\[
21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
\]

Grayson earns $84 from recycling in a four-week month.

answer:  To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plants Toni has.
2. Determine the number of plants Shondra has based on the information given.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants.

\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \text{ of Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.

\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = \text{Number of plants Toni has} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has \( 9 \) plants.

1. Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
2. Find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Theo gave the cashier to find the change.

First, let's calculate the cost of the piece of paper:
- The cost of the pen is $2.
- The cost of the piece of paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen.
- Therefore, the cost of the piece of paper is \(3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the pen and the cost of the piece of paper.
- So, the total cost is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the amount Theo gave the cashier (which is $10):
- The change Theo received is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

answer:  To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total walking time by the number of days to find the daily walking time.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk in three weeks:

- There are 7 days in a week.
- Jason can walk 4 days a week.
- Over three weeks, he will walk 4 days/week * 3 weeks = 12 days.

Next, we divide the total walking time by the number of days to find the daily walking time:

- Total walking time = 240 minutes
- Number of days = 12

Daily walking time = Total walking time / Number of days
Daily walking time = 240 minutes / 12 days
Daily walking time = 20 minutes/day

Therefore, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes and ensure he meets his goal in time to try out for the track team in three weeks.

The answer is 20 minutes.

answer:  Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat as \( c \).

According to his dad's rule, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Therefore, the total number of cookies Matt can have is:

\[ \frac{c}{2} + 2 \]

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first isolate the term with \( c \):

\[ \frac{c}{2} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{c}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ c = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ c = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to meet his goal of having 5 cookies in total, including the extra cookies for cleaning his room.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the remoras to the same units as the shark's body length. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the shark's body length from feet to inches:

10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}

Next, we calculate the combined length of the remoras:

2 \text{ remoras} \times 6 \text{ inches/remora} = 12 \text{ inches}

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100

\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100

\text{Percentage} = 10\%

The combined length of the two remoras represents 10% of the shark's body length.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( T \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students with a desktop computer is \( \frac{3}{4}T \).

We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means that the number of students without a desktop computer is 20.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of the students with a desktop computer and the students without a desktop computer:
\[ T = \frac{3}{4}T + 20 \]

To solve for \( T \), we first isolate \( T \) on one side of the equation:
\[ T - \frac{3}{4}T = 20 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4}T = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ T = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ T = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

answer:  To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Cost of the plane tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since Tom buys two tickets, the total cost for the tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

2. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.
   - The normal price is $1500 per day.
   - Therefore, the increased price is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800 per day.
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

3. **Total cost of the trip:**
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay: $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400.

answer:  To determine how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Given:
- \( |D| = 9 \)
- \( |P| = 6 \)
- \( |B| = 3 \)

The principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets states:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

If there are 32 kids in the class in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Next, we multiply the number of oranges Stetson ate by the amount he promised to give up for each orange:

Stetson promised to give up $10 for each orange he eats.

\[
\text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{\$240}\).

answer:  To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
2. Convert the total distance into hours based on his running speed.

First, let's calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
- James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.
- Total distance in a week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Next, we need to convert this total distance into hours using his running speed:
- James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
- Total hours in a week = Total distance / Speed = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

1. Determine the total number of eggs that can be placed on all the trays.
2. Subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays:
- Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
- Jaime has 2 trays.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) eggs.

Next, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
- Jaime has 64 eggs.
- The number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is 48.
- Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays is \( 64 - 48 = 16 \) eggs.

So, the number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray is \boxed{16} eggs.

1. Identify the highest temperatures for each country.
2. Add the highest temperatures together.
3. Divide the sum by the number of countries.

Let's go through the steps:

1. The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, add these temperatures together:
\[ -48 + 21 + (-3) \]

Calculate the sum:
\[ -48 + 21 = -27 \]
\[ -27 + (-3) = -30 \]

Next, divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3):
\[ \frac{-30}{3} \]

Calculate the average:
\[ \frac{-30}{3} = -10 \]

So, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

1. Calculate the total amount the child needs to save.
2. Subtract the amount the child already has from the total amount needed.
3. Divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find the number of days required.

1. The total amount the child needs to save is $12.
2. The child already has $4 in savings.
3. The child promises to save $2 daily.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount needed:

   - Remaining amount = $12 - $4
   - Remaining amount = $8

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8 at a rate of $2 per day:
   - Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
   - Number of days = $8 / $2
   - Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money for the toy if he saves $2 daily from his allowance.

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

Next, apply the buy one get one free offer. This means for every 2 packs, she gets 4 razors (since she pays for only half of them).

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

Now, apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost of 2 packs:

\[ 8.00 - 2.00 = $6.00 \]

Finally, calculate the cost per individual razor:

\[ \frac{6.00}{8} = $0.75 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, convert $0.75 to cents:

\[ 0.75 \times 100 = 75 \text{ cents} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost per person is $25.
- Food is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25x \).

To find the number of guests \( x \) that makes the two venues equal in cost, we set up the following equation:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

First, subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} = 10 \]

Therefore, Mark must have 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

Combine like terms:
\[ B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ B = 36 \]

Bodhi found 36 insects.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found:

Now, let's sum up the total number of animals at each location:
- The farm has \( 30 \) cows + \( 10 \) sheep = \( 40 \) animals.
- The zoo has \( 60 \) cows + \( 20 \) sheep = \( 80 \) animals.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Therefore, Rose bought \( 4O \) onions and \( 4P \) potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

\[ 4P = 4 \]

Solving for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes:

answer:  Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th, which is 7 months from December 31st. He has 7 months to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of days he has to lose 30 pounds:
- January has 16 days.
- February has 28 days.
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days.

Adding these up: 16 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 255 days.

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, he needs to lose 30 pounds, which means he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

So, Andy needs a calorie deficit of 105,000 / 255 = 400 calories per day.

answer:  To determine Tara's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags:
- Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags.
- Each pack costs $4.
- Total cost = 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:
- Tara sold each canvas bag for $8.
- She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 canvas bags.
- Total revenue = 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $320 - $32 = $288.

Tara earned a profit of $288 on her bags.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Convert the total distance into kilometers.
3. Determine the amount of water needed based on the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run:
- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- Hannah needs to run 8 laps.

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Next, we convert the total distance into kilometers:
- Total distance = 2 km

Now, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- Total distance = 2 km

Total water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500:

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

Next, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find out how much she has left after buying clothes:

\[ \text{Remaining money after clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Now, let's calculate how much she spent on CDs. She spent 25% of the remaining $400:

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find out how much she has left:

\[ \text{Final amount left} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie has $300 left.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:

\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is **$90,000**.

- Four $10 bills: 4 * $10 = $40
- Six $20 bills: 6 * $20 = $120

Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, determine how much money Ali gives to his sister:
-阿里 gives half of the total money to his sister: $160 / 2 = $80

Now, calculate the remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister:
- Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80

Then, calculate how much money Ali uses to buy dinner:
- Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner: (3/5) * $80 = $48

Finally, calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner:
- Amount left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein * 2 pairs = 2 skeins (since she needs 2 pairs)
- Socks: 2 skeins * 2 pairs = 4 skeins (since she needs 2 pairs)

Now, let's add up all the skeins needed for one grandchild:

2 skeins (hat) + 4 skeins (scarf) + 12 skeins (sweater) + 2 skeins (mittens) + 4 skeins (socks) = 24 skeins per grandchild

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the number of skeins for one grandchild by 3:

24 skeins per grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 72 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 72 skeins of wool to make enough winter wear for all 5 items for each of her 3 grandchildren.

1. Calculate the total amount of raisins available for each item.
2. Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with the available raisins.

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ items}} = 9 \text{ cups per item} \]

Next, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed per batch:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches} \]

\[ 12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 84 \text{ kWh/week} \]

The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour per day. Therefore, her new daily consumption will be:

\[ 12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day} \]

When she adds the new device, her weekly consumption will be:

\[ 14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 98 \text{ kWh/week} \]

The difference in her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:

\[ 98 \text{ kWh/week} - 84 \text{ kWh/week} = 14 \text{ kWh/week} \]

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is 14 kWh per week.

answer:  To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \( 2 \times 31 = 62 \) mm thick.

Now, we add these thicknesses together:
\[ 31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm} \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

answer:  To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earns for completing 20 tasks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 for each task.
- Jairus completed 20 tasks.
- Jairus's total earnings = $0.8/task × 20 tasks = $<<0.8*20=16>>16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 for each task.
- Jenny completed 20 tasks.
- Jenny's total earnings = $0.5/task × 20 tasks = $<<0.5*20=10>>10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's total earnings = $16
- Jenny's total earnings = $10
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $<<16-10=6>>6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

answer:  First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy received:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, each boy initially received $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Then, he added another $10 the following day:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Now, the eldest boy has $21.

Next, he spent $8 from his total:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After spending $8, he has $13 left.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. So, he tri:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, the total amount he has now is:

\[ 13 + 39 = 52 \]

So, the eldest boy now has $52.

answer:  Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. April has 30 days, so he needs to save $1125 / 30 = $37.50 per day on average.

He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. Since April has 30 days, the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.

In the first half, he saves $37.50 per day for 15 days, which totals to $37.50 * 15 = $562.50.

In the second half, he needs to save twice as much as in the first half, so he needs to save $37.50 * 2 = $75 per day.

To meet his monthly target of $1125, he needs to save $75 * 15 = $1125 in the second half.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $75 each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly target of $1125.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money they have together is $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 4B \]
\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

answer:  To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week.

First, let's calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day:
- Jeff's work is 3 miles away.
- He walks to work and back each day.
- Therefore, the distance he walks in one day is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week:
- Jeff works 5 days a week.
- The distance he walks in one day is 6 miles.
- Therefore, the distance he walks in one week is:
  \[
  6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

So, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:

answer:  Elise writes the full alphabet twice, which is \( 2 \times 26 = 52 \) letters.

She then writes half of the alphabet once, which is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.

Next, she re-writes everything she has already written. She has already written the full alphabet twice and the half of it once, which totals \( 52 + 13 = 65 \) letters.

So, she re-writes all 65 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters she has written is:
- Full alphabet twice: \( 2 \times 26 = 52 \) letters
- Half of the alphabet once: \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters
- Re-writing everything: \( 65 \) letters

Adding these together:

2. Calculate how many more toys Jonathan needs to reach this total.
3. Add the information that he needs 2 more toys than he already has to find out how many toys he currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so:

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

Next, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

answer:  When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long, which means he swims a mile in 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day, we need to calculate the total time for each scenario and then find the difference.

On a cold day:
- Time to swim a mile = 16 minutes
- Time to swim 3 miles = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a warm day:
- Time to swim a mile = 34 minutes
- Time to swim 3 miles = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes

The difference in time between a warm day and a cold day is:

Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks:

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended amount, we need to find the exact value of \( R \). However, the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \). Therefore, we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:

answer:  To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine their individual weights.

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we find the average weight by dividing the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

answer:  To determine the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider both the initial angle of the pyramid and the rate at which the sun is moving.

1. **Initial angle of the pyramid:**
   The pyramid sits at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of the sun's movement:**
   The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time period:**
   The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total angle moved by the sun:**
   \[
   \text{Total angle moved} = 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Total angle from the ground to the sun:**
   \[
   \text{Total angle} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, after 10 hours, there will be 82 degrees from the ground to the sun.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to sum up the amounts received for each category of teeth lost.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each. So, the total for these three teeth is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, she received half the amount she received for the next three teeth. Since she received $1.00 per tooth for the next three teeth, she received $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, the total for these two teeth is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts received:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.

answer:  In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days, so she read a total of 15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes.
Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. 

First, we calculate how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/interval = 70 intervals.
Since she reads 2 pages per interval, the total number of pages she read in the first week is:
70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages.

Therefore, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks.

answer:  To determine how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor and then subtract these from the total number of sandwiches.

First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate:
Cody ate a third of the sandwiches.
\[ \text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate:
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches.
\[ \text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:
\[ \text{Total sandwiches eaten} = \text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} + \text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:
\[ \text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 sandwiches left.

answer:  Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \).

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old} \]

At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

To verify, let's check the condition:
In 7 years, Shiloh will be 51 years old, which is indeed three times his nephew's age at that time.

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Therefore, Mark scored \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) goals.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Therefore, Anna scored \( 80 - 45 = 35 \) goals.

Now, we sum up the goals scored by all three teenagers:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} \]

\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 per day = $30 on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so he can buy $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week, which is Thursday to Saturday, he spends $10 per day = $40 on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 6 wooden action figures + 20 plastic action figures = 26 action figures by the end of the week.

answer:  To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes over 2 years and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount removed over 2 years:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Over 2 years, there are \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) months.

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she removes:
\[ 100 \times 24 = 2400 \]

Now, let's subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount:
- Initial amount: $3000
- Total amount removed: $2400

- Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
- Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- Therefore, 10 sandwiches require 1 loaf of bread.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches:
- They spend $30.00 on cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of making 10 sandwiches:
- Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
- Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- Each sandwich sells for $7.00.
- Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00.

- Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4: 120 birds
- Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 470 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7 days) to find the average:

Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average birds per day = 470 birds / 7 days
Average birds per day ≈ 67.14 birds/day

Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Therefore, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the number of cups and dishes each brought.

Judy's total utensils:

So, the oven is off by 4%.

Next, we need to find the actual temperature when Maggie sets the oven to 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, we calculate the actual temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Actual temperature} = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) = 520 \times 0.96 = 491.2 \text{ degrees} \]

answer:  First, calculate the total calories burned from each activity:

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Next, add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:

1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, determine how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. She needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories, divide 1600 by 200:

1600 calories / 200 calories/set = 8 sets

Finally, multiply the number of sets by the amount of water needed per set to find the total amount of water needed:

8 sets * 100 ml/set = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

The answer is 800 ml.

answer:  To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weight of each dog step by step.

1. **Affenpinscher:**
   - The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund:**
   - The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   - Therefore, the Dachshund weighs \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pounds.

3. **Papillon:**
   - The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   - Therefore, the Papillon weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pounds.

4. **Mastiff:**
   - The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   - Therefore, the Mastiff weighs \( 44 \times 5 = 220 \) pounds.

Hence, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

So, the final answer is:

answer:  To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial typing speed.
2. Calculate the new typing speed after the first increase.
3. Calculate the new typing speed after the second increase.
4. Add the three measurements together.
5. Divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average.

Let's go through each step:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. New typing speed after the first increase: 52 WPM
3. New typing speed after the second increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, add the three measurements together:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

Finally, divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

Final answer: 52 WPM = <<52 WPM=52>>52

answer:  To determine the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will lose: \( 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \)

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will gain: \( 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \)

Now, we find the difference in weight:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds.

answer:  Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2(J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

- Shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.com:
- Difference: Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon.com
- Difference = $21 - $20
- Difference = $1

Therefore, the boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay.

answer:  To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake.

First, let's find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:
- A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, in 200 grams of mushrooms, the amount of protein is:
  \[
  \frac{200 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 3 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the weekly protein intake:
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the weekly protein intake is:
  \[
  6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams}
  \]

John gets 42 grams of protein per week.

answer:  To find the total number of legs for all the pets in the store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - There are 5 dogs.
   - Total legs from dogs = 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.

2. **Cats:**
   - Each cat has 4 legs.
   - There are 2 cats.
   - Total legs from cats = 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.

3. **Birds:**
   - Each bird has 2 legs.
   - There are 10 birds.
   - Total legs from birds = 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 48.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

1. Each implant has a base price of $2000.
2. George needs 2 implants, so the base cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\).
3. One of the implants has an additional cost of $500 for the crown, so the total cost for the implants is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\).

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

answer:  Let the smallest angle in the triangle be \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem, the other angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
The third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

In the first year, he buys 1 game per month, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games. Adding the 10 games he already has, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games. Adding the 22 games he already has, he has 22 + 24 = 46 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games. Adding the 46 games he already has, he has 46 + 48 = 94 games.

Additionally, he receives 5 games for Christmas each year, so over 3 years, he gets 5 * 3 = 15 games.

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve will have 94 + 15 = 109 games.

\[ 2 \text{ pumps} \times 120 \text{ washings} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, so she uses 240 pumps in total.

Next, we need to find the cost per pump. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.1 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

To convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel the additional 2000 miles at this speed. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{2000}{400} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

For the first 5 months, he received $100,000 per month, so the total cost for the first phase is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 45 months, he received 50% more funding per month. This means he received an additional $100,000 * 0.5 = $50,000 per month.

So, the total cost for the remaining 45 months is $50,000 * 45 = $2,250,000.

She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece, so the cost is 3 * $2.00 = $<<3*2.00=6.00>>6.00.
She bought 20 fish for $0.50 each, so the cost is 20 * $0.50 = $<<20*0.50=10.00>>10.00.
She needed fish food that cost $2.00.
Adding up all these expenses, Scarlett spent $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $<<10+5+6+10+2=33.00>>33.00 in total.
The answer is $33.00

answer:  To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the total cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194 per meter = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194 per meter = $95,260.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = $95,260 - $29,100 = $66,160.

Therefore, it costs $66,160 more to repave Lewis' street than to repave Monica's street.

answer:  To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the amounts eaten by each player and then sum them up.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, with each beef tip being 1 ounce.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, so they do not contribute to the meat consumption.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of meat consumed:

- The first player ate 6 ounces.
- The second player ate 8 ounces (since each beef tip is 1 ounce).
- The third player ate 16 ounces (since 1 pound equals 16 ounces).

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

#### 30 ounces

Therefore, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

answer:  To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection:
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections:
- There are 4 intersections.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights across all intersections is \( 24 \times 4 = 96 \).

Finally, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:
- There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
- Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is \( 96 - 20 = 76 \).

answer:  To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water.

First, let's find the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year:
- Gary does laundry twice a week.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Therefore, Gary does 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/week.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water used in a year:
- Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- So, 104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the water:
- A gallon of water costs $0.15.
- Therefore, 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

So, Gary spends $312 on water for his laundry in a year.

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.

So, the total amount of meat sold in one day is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the amount of meat sold in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \text{ kg}}{150 \text{ kg/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

answer:  To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost per class and then see how many classes he can miss without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

First, let's find the maximum cost per class:
\[ \text{Maximum cost per class} = \$10 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Manny attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 classes} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100 \]

Now, let's find out how many classes Manny can miss without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Since the total cost for 10 classes is $100 and he can't spend more than $10 per class, he can only attend 10 classes. Therefore, he can attend all 10 classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

So, the number of classes he can miss is:

answer:  To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between Tom and Bob and then use that to find the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap.

First, let's find the relative speed:
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:
- Distance to be closed: 75 miles
- Relative speed: 15 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it takes to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

answer:  To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Julie's daily production.
2. Calculate the total daily production for both Julie and Jewel.
3. Multiply the total daily production by 7 (the number of days in a week) to find the total weekly production.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total daily production for both Julie and Jewel:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} + 100 \text{ customers/day} = 150 \text{ customers/day} \]

Finally, we multiply the total daily production by 7 to find the total weekly production:
\[ 150 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers.

answer:  Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as \( L \) miles.

Given:
- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.
- Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran \( L + 3 \) miles.

We can set up the equation based on the total distance run by all three:
\[ \text{Paisley's distance} + \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 + 20 = L + (L + 3) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 24 = 2L + 3 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 24 - 3 = 2L \]
\[ 21 = 2L \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 11 \]

So, Lynn ran 11 miles.

Answer: \( \boxed{11} \).

answer:  To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the first website:
- The first website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the first website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the second website:
- The second website publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the second website = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
- Total articles by both websites = 560 articles (first website) + 280 articles (second website) = 840 articles.

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is \(\boxed{840}\).

answer:  First, we need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 5 apples:
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the apples and oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

answer:  To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of all the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third of the king cab upgrade cost, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \)
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \)
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add up all these costs:

\[ 30,000 \, (\text{king cab}) + 7,500 \, (\text{leather seats}) + 2,000 \, (\text{running boards}) + 1,500 \, (\text{upgraded exterior light package}) = 41,000 \]

\[ 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:

\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, let's calculate the bonus Tim receives. The bonus is worth half a month's salary, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

Now, let's find his total monthly earnings after the raise and bonus:

\[ 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Finally, to find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his monthly earnings by 12:

\[ 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, Tim will make $372000 in a year.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil and needs to dig 24 feet:

\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half his speed through clay, which is 2 feet per hour, and needs to dig 8 feet:

\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add the time for digging through the soil and the time for digging through the clay to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for soil} + \text{Time for clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, so:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150 \]

He buys 10 dress pants, and each dress pant costs $150:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

He buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dress shirts} \]

Each dress shirt costs $60:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

To find the total cost, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Distance Alisa = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance Stanley = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances Alisa and Stanley biked to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance Alisa + Distance Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese.

We have two equations based on the information given:
1. The total number of animal legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)
2. The total number of animal heads: \( S + G = 20 \)

First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Thus, there are 5 geese. This ensures both conditions are satisfied.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Next, Roger decides to buy a week's worth of coffee. He uses 1 pound per day for 7 days.

\[ \text{Total weight of coffee} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the coffee:

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the cost of the donut:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought other than the apple pie:

1. 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
3. Bottle of soda: $1.00

Adding these costs together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cost of these items from the total amount Gus spent at the grocery store to find the cost of the apple pie:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

Next, determine the number of math teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Now, calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day. Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, multiply the number of math teachers by the time each teacher sleeps:

\[ \text{Total sleep time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

answer:  To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.

1. Calculate the amount of dry ingredients for one muffin:
   - Flour: 5 tablespoons
   - Sugar: 3 tablespoons
   - Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

   Total dry ingredients for one muffin = flour + sugar + salt
   Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 tablespoons + 3 tablespoons + 0.25 tablespoons
   Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 8.25 tablespoons

2. Calculate the total amount of dry ingredients for 16 muffins:
   Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = total dry ingredients for one muffin * 16
   Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 8.25 tablespoons * 16
   Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The answer is 132.

answer:  James initially has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 more toys for the 12 new dogs.
After buying the toys, James goes back and sees that there are twice as many more dogs as when he left. Since he left with 12 dogs, twice as many more dogs is 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
So, the new total number of dogs is 12 + 24 = 36 dogs.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 36 more toys for the 36 new dogs.
When James comes back again, he finds that 3 dogs are gone, so the new number of dogs is 36 - 3 = 33 dogs.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 33 more toys for the 33 remaining dogs.
In total, James needs 12 + 36 + 33 = 81 toys for the dogs in the shelter.

1. **Initial Good Days:**
   - Christina had 12 good days in the first 32 days.

2. **Additional Days:**
   - The next three days were good, neutral, and good.
   - Therefore, the first and third days are good, and the second day is neutral.

3. **Total Good Days:**
   - Adding the initial good days to the additional good days:
     \[
     12 \text{ (initial good days)} + 2 \text{ (additional good days)} = 14 \text{ good days}
     \]

4. **Good Days Left in the Month:**
   - The month has 30 days.
   - Using the total number of good days:
     \[
     30 \text{ (total days)} - 14 \text{ (good days)} = 16 \text{ days}

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. We calculate the required growth by subtracting the current height from the final height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo's height to be 600 inches.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is \( t + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ t + (t + 7) + 3(t + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ t + t + 7 + 3t + 21 = 44 \]
\[ 5t + 28 = 44 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides:

\[ 5t = 16 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ t = \frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 3.2 years.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's determine the total bill. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( T \) be the total bill. Then the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.6T \).

So, we can write the equation:

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

Therefore, the total bill is $100.

Now, let's calculate how much money John has left after his expenses. He brought $125 with him, and the total bill is $100. So:

answer:  First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta. Since Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling. Therefore, the number of cookies left in the box is:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total time spent on homework = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, let's convert the total time John has before dinner into minutes:
- 3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time he has before dinner:
- Total time before dinner = 180 minutes
- Time spent on homework = 80 minutes

Time for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of one candy. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. The total cost of five lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Therefore, the cost of four candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Since he bought four candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Adding these together, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies for Manolo is $7.00.

answer:  To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we multiply the number of each color of square by the area of each square (which is 1 foot by 1 foot):

- Red squares: 14 * 1 = 14 square feet
- Blue squares: 18 * 1 = 18 square feet
- Green squares: 24 * 1 = 24 square feet
- White squares: 12 * 1 = 12 square feet

Finally, we add up the areas of all the squares to find the total area of the comforter:

Total area = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 square feet

Therefore, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet in total.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so:

\[ \text{Total number of people} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = \text{Number of high chairs} + \text{Number of regular chairs} = 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Finally, we determine how many more chairs are needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Total chairs needed} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

2. Betty: 50 points + 30% of 50 points = 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points
3. Marta: 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. Therefore, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.
4. Tom: 35 points (as calculated above)

Now, let's add up all the points:

50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 105 (Marta) + 35 (Tom) = 255 points

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:

Each person saves a seat, so there are 20 seats.

Each seat can hold:
- 1 person
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

So, each seat can hold a total of 1 person + 2 drinks + 3 snacks = 6 items.

Each drink and snack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for each seat is:
\[ 6 \text{ items} \times \$2 \text{ per item} = \$12 \text{ per seat} \]

There are 20 seats, so the total cost for all the seats is:
\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times \$12 \text{ per seat} = \$240 \]

1. Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City.
2. Determine the percentage of that water used for industrial purposes.
3. Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by Colorado City to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, let's calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City:
- Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

Next, let's determine what percentage of that water is used for industrial purposes:
- 80% of the water used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes.

Now, let's subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by Colorado City to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
- Percentage used for non-industrial purposes = Total percentage used by Colorado City - Percentage used for industrial purposes
- Percentage used for non-industrial purposes = 40% - 80% = 20%

Therefore, Colorado City uses 20% of the Colorado River for non-industrial purposes.

1. Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
2. Subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's capacity.

First, we know Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck can carry:
\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is:
\[ 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry:

The ratio of money divided between Gerald and Julia is 3:2. This means for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts.

The total amount of money is $100, so the total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we can calculate Gerald's share:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Gerald received $60.

Next, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book.

Gerald initially had $60. After spending $10, he has:

1. The deal is "buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free." This means for every 3 scoops Erin buys, she gets 3 scoops in total.
2. Each scoop costs $1.50.
3. Erin has $6.00.

Let's calculate how many scoops she can buy for $6.00:

\[ \text{Number of scoops} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per scoop}} = \frac{6}{1.50} = 4 \]

Since the deal is "buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free," for every 3 scoops she buys, she gets 3 scoops in total. Therefore, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free.

If Erin buys 4 scoops, she will get 6 scoops in total.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts

For vanilla ice cream:
- 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

1. Determine the new price per computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers.

First, let's calculate the new price per computer:
- The original price per computer is $700.
- The increase is 10% of $700.
- 10% of $700 is \( 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \).
- Therefore, the new price per computer is \( 700 + 70 = 770 \).

Next, we calculate the total amount paid:
- The company wants to buy 500 computers.
- The new price per computer is $770.
- The total amount paid is \( 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \).

Next, let's calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \]

So, Amy has 14 pieces more candy than Ginger after two weeks.

answer:  To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the bathroom.
2. Determine the area that needs to be covered.
3. Calculate the number of mosaic tiles required for the coverage area.

1. The total area of the bathroom is 36 square feet.
2. The area that needs to be covered is two-thirds of the total area:
   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet}
   \]
3. For each square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, the number of mosaic tiles required for 24 square feet is:
   \[
   \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ tiles}
   \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The answer is 576 tiles.

answer:  To determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sacks of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother.
2. Determine the weight of the rice in each sack.
3. Multiply the number of sacks given by the weight per sack to find the total weight.

First, let's find the total number of sacks given:
- Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- Goldy gave 4 sacks to her brother.
- Total sacks given = 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks.

Next, we know that each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice.

Now, we multiply the number of sacks given by the weight per sack to find the total weight:
- Total weight = 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg.

Therefore, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for James to pick the blueberries himself.

1. The cost to go picking is $20.
2. The cost per pound of blueberries is $1.5.
3. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost for picking:
\[ 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store.

1. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
2. James bought 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost at the store:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]

Now, let's find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself instead of buying them at the store.

Savings amount = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
\[ Savings amount = 75 - 65 = 10 \]

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself instead of buying them at the store.

answer:  To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each component and then sum them up.

1. **Calories from eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. **Calories from cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Calories from ham:**
   - John uses 2 oz of ham.
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so they each ate 2/3 * 12 slices per pizza = 8 slices. Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends), they ate a total of 3 people * 8 slices per person = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate 3/4 * 12 slices per pizza = 9 slices. Since there are two people, they ate a total of 2 people * 9 slices per person = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 slices + 24 slices = 48 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left is 60 slices - 48 slices = 12 slices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
- The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
- The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 per bucket is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's consider the potential cost of the damage to his car if the pothole isn't fixed:
- The damage to his car is $450.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential cost of the damage to find the savings:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

answer:  To find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of sausages (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is \( 25 \) minutes.

Total number of spools:
- Light blue spools: 15

- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Number of blue spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

Now, we calculate the percentage of blue spools:
Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100
Percentage of blue spools = 40%

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 104 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( B \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can write the equation:

\[ 104 = 9B + 10 \]

To find \( B \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 94 = 9B \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ B = \frac{94}{9} = 10.44 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10.44 \) inches.

1. **Initial Slices:**
   - The plate initially had 2 slices of cake.

2. **Adding Slices:**
   - Mara added 3 more slices to the plate.
   - Total slices after adding 3 slices: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) slices.

3. **Tripling the Slices:**
   - Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has.
   - Total slices after tripling: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) slices.

4. **Mara Eating Slices:**
   - Mara ate 2 slices.
   - Total slices after Mara ate: \( 15 - 2 = 13 \) slices.

5. **Friend Stealing Slices:**

answer:  Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

Given:
- Total number of students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = twice the number who like to play basketball, so \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)

First, calculate the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music:
- Total students who like to bake, play basketball, or both = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35

Now, we know that the number of students who like to play video games \( V \) plus the number of students who like to play music \( M \) equals 35:
\[ V + M = 35 \]
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

answer:  To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many books Steven has.
2. Determine how many books Alice has.
3. Calculate the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 2S = 20 \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, Alice has:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Finally, we calculate the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]
So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]

\[ \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Next, we calculate the number of birds that were not scared away:

\[ \text{Number of birds not scared away} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

So, 8 birds were not scared away.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined these 8 birds:

\[ \text{Total number of birds now} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Therefore, there are now 28 birds in the backyard.

answer:  To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor and the new vendor, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.50.
- Daily cost from the old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.50 per tomato = $250.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.40.
- Daily cost from the new vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.40 per tomato = $200.

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two vendors:
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:
- Weekly savings = $50/day * 7 days = $350.

He gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the combined value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

The remaining 30 cards are worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

The total value of all the cards is:
\[ 4000 + 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, and each person must either vote in favor of the new regulation or against it. Therefore, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against:

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it:

According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases, and the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed by all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms is:

\[ 20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

answer:  To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchases and then sum these amounts.

1. **Leila's Purchase:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - Each cucumber costs $2.
   - Total cost for cucumbers: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Jack's Purchase:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Chase's Purchase:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce: \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the total costs:
\[ 6 \text{ (cupumbers)} + 5 \text{ (tomatoes)} + 3 \text{ (lettuce)} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has after receiving money from Ava.
2. Subtract the cost of the camera from the total amount of money Jayden has.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jayden has after receiving money from Ava:

- Jayden initially has $70 from selling pictures.
- Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance.
- Half of $90 is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \).

So, the total amount of money Jayden has is:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

Next, let's subtract the cost of the camera from the total amount of money Jayden has:

- The cost of the camera is $200.
- Jayden has $115.

So, the amount of money Jayden still needs is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs to#### $85 more to buy the camera.

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has.

George has 45% more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 45\% \text{ of Number of bananas} \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 290 \]

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 \]

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 490 \]

George has 490 fruits.

answer:  To find the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we first need to determine how many books Ahmed read.

We know that Ezra read 300 books and that he read twice as many books as Ahmed. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as \( A \).

So, we have:
\[ 300 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Ahmed read 150 books.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books read by Ezra after he has already read 300 books and decided to read 150 more:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Ezra read a total of 450 books.

Finally, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed to find the total:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is:

answer:  To determine how many wheels will be left after Henry assembles all the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles, and then subtract that from the total number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:
- Each car has 4 wheels.
- There are 57 cars.
- Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
- Each motorcycle has 2 wheels.
- There are 73 motorcycles.
- Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add the total number of wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles:
- Total wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 76 wheels.

answer:  Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Therefore, she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.5 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 50\% \]

1. Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold.
2. Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- There are 4 vanilla scents available.
- Each vanilla scent is sold 5 times.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 4 vanilla scents * 5 sales per scent = 20 vanilla scents.

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- There are 8 fruity scents available.
- Each fruity scent is sold 2 times.
- Total fruity scents sold = 8 fruity scents * 2 sales per scent = 16 fruity scents.

Finally, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more scents.

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Driving time = 4 hours (since the total time is 6 hours and they spent 1.5 hours hiking)
Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles per hour × 4 hours = 200 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
Hiking speed = 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed
Hiking speed = (50 miles per hour / 2) - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour
Hiking time = 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance to their vacation spot:
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 200 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

Therefore, their vacation spot was 230 miles away.

1. **Driving Time:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 miles per hour
   - Time to drive = Distance / Speed
   - Time to drive = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Total Driving Time:**
   - Since the trip is round trip, Jack drives to the museum and then back home.
   - Total driving time = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back home
   - Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

3. **Time Spent at the Museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. **Total Time Gone from Home:**
   - Total time gone from home = Total driving time + Time spent at the museum

answer:  To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Subtract the amount covered by the school from the total cost.
3. Subtract the amount John has from the remaining amount.

First, let's find the total cost of the trip:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$300 \]

Next, we know that the school is covering half of the cost:
\[ \text{Amount covered by the school} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$300 = \$150 \]

Now, subtract the amount covered by the school from the total cost:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$300 - \$150 = \$150 \]

Finally, subtract the amount John has from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Amount missing} = \$150 - \$50 = \$100 \]

So, John is missing $100.

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Finally, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

 Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

answer:  To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature difference between the day and night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it is 33 degrees colder at night. Therefore, the temperature at night is:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Carson's house will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees. To prevent this, he needs to keep the temperature at night at 32 degrees or higher. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, he needs to increase the temperature by:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase required by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.

answer:  To determine how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike has to pay.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:
The original price of the jeans is $40, and the discount is 25% off.
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Finally, we subtract the sale price from the amount Mike has to pay:
Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.
\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

The final amount of money left over is:

answer:  To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of the bottle caps in the 30-day month.

First, let's find the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total number of bottle caps he finds in a 30-day month is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of these bottle caps:
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

So, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups had members bring back seashells. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of groups with seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups with seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ \text{Total number of seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

answer:  Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours of work each day.
For the first 8 hours, she earns $20/hour * 8 hours = $<<20*8=160>>160.

She worked a total of 11 hours last Tuesday, so she worked 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 additional hours.

For these additional hours, she is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate.
Her regular hourly rate is $20, so 150% of $20 is $20 * 1.5 = $<<20*1.5=30>>30 per hour.

For the additional 3 hours, she earns $30/hour * 3 hours = $<<30*3=90>>90.

To find the total amount she was paid for her work that day, we add her earnings for the first 8 hours and her earnings for the additional 3 hours:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months.

1. Initial number of employees: 200
   The company hires 20 new employees every month. Therefore, after three months, there will be:
   200 + (20 * 3) = 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

2. Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total monthly salary for all employees is:
   260 * $4000 = $104,000.

3. To find the total amount of money paid over three months, multiply the total monthly salary by 3:
   $104,000 * 3 = $312,000.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, she plays for 2 * 7 = 14 days.
- She plays for half an hour each day, so in 14 days she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

For the next week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in 1 week, she plays for 1 * 7 = 7 days.
- She plays for 2 hours each day, so in 7 days she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Adding these together, Kris has played a total of 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours to reach her goal.

1. Calculate Nikita's points.
2. Add Pierson's points to Nikita's points.

First, let's calculate Nikita's points:

Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

- Half of Pierson's points: \( \frac{278}{2} = 139 \)
- Adding 11 to 139: \( 139 + 11 = 150 \)

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Next, we add Pierson's points to Nikita's points:

- Pierson's points: 278
- Nikita's points: 150

Total points = Pierson's points + Nikita's points
Total points = 278 + 150
Total points = 428

Therefore, Pierson and Nikita scored a total of 428 points.

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, let's find the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25 and he made $105 in total, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount of money by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week (which is 7) to find the average number of branches climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

1. Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
2. Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
3. Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so 40 * 2 = 80 out of 400 passed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:

- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 80

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Next, let's calculate the overall pass rate. The overall pass rate is the number of students who passed divided by the total number of students, multiplied by 100.

Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

2. The amount of citrus zest used is the same as the amount of fragrance, so it is \( s \) ounces.
3. The amount of sugar used is the same as the amount of salt, so it is \( s \) ounces.

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all the ingredients:

2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Adding these together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, let's account for the fact that Rose loses 1 flower from each type:

- 1 flower from each type means: 1 flower * 1 petal/flower = 1 petal (since each flower has 1 petal)

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
101 petals - 1 petal = 100 petals

Therefore, there are 100 petals on the flowers in the vase.

answer:  To determine how many additional students have joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students (end of January):** 10
2. **End of January (end of February):** \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
3. **End of February (end of March):** \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
4. **End of March (end of April):** \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
5. **End of April (end of May):** \(80 \times 2 = 160\)

Now, we find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students:

\[ 160 - 10 = 150 \]

Therefore, 150 additional students have joined by the end of May compared to the initial number of students at the beginning of the year.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean:
- John makes 9 S'mores.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores.
- Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we need to subtract the marshmallows dropped on the ground and the initial number of marshmallows in the bag:
- The bag initially had 35 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.
- Marshmallows left = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores can be made with the remaining marshmallows:
- Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow.
- Number of S'mores that can be made with 14 marshmallows = 14.

Since there are two kids (John and DeSean), they will share the remaining S'mores equally:
- Each kid can have 14 S'mores / 2 kids = 7 S'mores.

Answer: 7 S'mores.

answer:  To determine how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money raised by the students.
2. Divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

First, let's find the total amount of money raised by the students:

\[ \text{Total amount raised by students} = \text{Total amount raised by charity} - \text{Amount raised by organizations} \]
\[ \text{Total amount raised by students} = 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

\[ \text{Amount raised by each student} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised by students}}{\text{Number of students}} \]
\[ \text{Amount raised by each student} = \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\).

answer:  To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $<<3*500=1500>>1500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $<<2*1500=3000>>3000.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows
- Total amount spent = $1500 + $3000 = $<<1500+3000=4500>>4500.

answer:  Jack can play for 1 quarter every 20 minutes, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he can play 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so each can play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. Since there are two friends, they can play for 120 * 2 = 240 minutes each, and they can play 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. He can play 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.
In total, they can play 12 + 12 + 18 = 42 quarters.
Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $<<42*0.25=10.50>>10.50

\[ \text{Julie's score in the first game} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Next, we know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie did in the first game.

\[ \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 8 \]

Now, we can find the total points Sasha scored in both games by adding her scores from each game.

\[ \text{Total points Sasha scored} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 8 = 22 \]

- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Next, calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day:
- Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day.
- Half of 8 hours is 4 hours.
- Therefore, 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, add the time from both days to find the total time:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, after selling and giving away some cars, Joe remains with:

- The shipping cost per pound is $0.35.
- Total shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40.
- The book needs to be shipped 20 miles.
- The shipping cost per mile is $0.08.
- Total shipping cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.
- Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

1. Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day.
2. Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

First, let's determine the number of tasks John completes in one day:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Therefore, the number of tasks per day = 30 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Next, let's calculate the number of tasks John completes in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the number of tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days = 1050 tasks/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for the week:
- Each task pays $1.20.
- Therefore, the total earnings for the week = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 151 \]

Therefore, Becca has 151 cards.

answer:  To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she wants installed and then add that to the base installation price.

First, let's calculate the total number of additional items Angela wants installed:
- Additional mirrors: 6
- Additional chandeliers: 2
- Additional pictures: 20

Total additional items = 6 + 2 + 20 = 28

Next, we calculate the cost of these additional items:
- Cost per additional item = $15.00

Total cost for additional items = 28 * $15.00 = $420.00

Finally, we add the cost of the additional items to the base installation price:
- Base installation price = $129.00
- Total cost for additional items = $420.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela to have all the additional items installed and hung will be $549.00.

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current milk production from the desired total:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk. We do this by dividing the additional milk needed by the milk production of one cow:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to achieve his goal of producing 25 liters of milk a day.

answer:  To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers in each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. Distance traveled in the first segment:
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. Distance traveled in the second segment:
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, add the distances from both segments to find the total distance:
- Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Erika already has in her purse as \( S \).

The original price of the laptop is $600, and with the $200 discount for trading in her old laptop, the new price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so she currently has:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she has received is:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her original savings and the money she has received:
\[ S + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 230 from both sides:
\[ S = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has \( $120 \) in her purse.

answer:  To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left.
   - Length of the first glue stick left = \( \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \) millimeters = 2 millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left.
   - Length of the second glue stick left = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \) millimeters = 8 millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left.
   - Length of the third glue stick left = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \) millimeters = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the remaining glue sticks:
- Total length = 2 millimeters + 8 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 16 millimeters.

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

answer:  To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.

The cost of the car is $10000, and the cost of the phone is $800. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

Next, we add the amount of money Gabriel already has to the amount his brother gave him:
- Gabriel has $5000.
- His brother gave him $200.

Adding these together:
\[ 5000 + 200 = 5200 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the car and the phone to find out how much more money he needs:
\[ 10800 - 5200 = 5600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone.

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = \frac{3 \times 300}{4} = \frac{900}{4} = 225 \]

Next, calculate the total interest over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Finally, add the total interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, Brenda will have $975 in total after 3 years.

\[ \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, let's determine how many socks Peter has. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:

\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's determine how many dishes Peter has. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:

\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Finally, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total socks and dishes} = \text{Jack's socks} + \text{Jack's dishes} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Given:
- Total number of students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good in English only = 8

First, let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students good at math only and good in English only, we can calculate the number of students good at both as follows:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good in English only}) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - 13 \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 7 \]

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, let's find the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:
- James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the total number of pairs of shoes in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs} \]

Next, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair:
- James spends $2640 on shoes each year.

So, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \frac{2640}{24} = $110 \]

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes.

Then, find the number of floral shirts without buttons:
\[ \text{Floral shirts without buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Finally, calculate how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Floral shirts without buttons} - \text{White shirts without collars} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time available for each group to perform:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the 10-minute intermission:
- Total show time: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Total available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform by dividing the total available time by the time each group takes:
- Number of groups = Total available time for groups / Total time per group
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group
- Number of groups = 11

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we would need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

According to the problem:
1. Your age is \( B - 3 \) (since you are three years younger than your brother).
2. Your sister's age is \( B - 2 \) (since you are two years older than your sister).
3. Your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 3) + (B - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 5B = 96 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = 19 \]

So, your brother is 19 years old. Your age is:

1. **Initial amount of water passing through the river:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After a day of heavy rain:**
   The amount of water passing through the river doubles. Therefore, we calculate the new amount as follows:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30 \]

We are given that the number of gold coins is 70. So, we can set up the equation:

To find \( S \), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 70 - 30 = S \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins to find the total number of coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins in total.

In a 1 year time frame, there are 12 months.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes 2 months to earn a badge, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges / 2 months per badge = 6 badges.

Wendy earns 3 badges per month, so in 12 months, she earns 3 badges per month * 12 months = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 more badges than Amber.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

answer:  Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

First, let's determine how many loaves she baked:
- She bakes 2 loaves per hour.
- In 5 hours, she bakes 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices:
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50.
- So, 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

Paige raised $40 by selling all the slices.

answer:  To determine the number of yellow cars, we first need to calculate the number of red, green, and blue cars and then subtract these from the total number of cars.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:**
   - The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10

3. **Blue Cars:**
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   - Number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Total red, green, and blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52

The total number of cars is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
- Number of yellow cars = Total cars - Total red, green, and blue cars
- Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

According to the problem:
1. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 11 = 85 \]

Subtract 11 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 85 - 11 \]
\[ 3F = 74 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = \frac{74}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

answer:  To determine how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of marbles Paul has.
2. Add the number of marbles his friend gave him.
3. Subtract the number of marbles he lost.

Let's go through each step:

1. Paul initially has 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so we add these to his initial number:
   \[
   52 + 28 = 80
   \]
   Now, Paul has 80 marbles.
3. Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
   \]
   So, Paul lost 20 marbles. We subtract these from his current total:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is \( \boxed{60} \).

1. Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts:
- Each bolt costs $0.03.
- David wants to buy 16 bolts.
- Total cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt
- Total cost = 16 bolts × $0.03/bolt
- Total cost = $0.48

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:
- David has $12.48.
- Total cost of the bolts is $0.48.
- Money left = Total money David has - Total cost of the bolts
- Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
- Money left = $12.00

Therefore, after paying for the 16 packs of bolts, David has $12.00 left.

answer:  To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to account for the extended runtime of her final concert and the encore.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the length of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes.

Additionally, she performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the final concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the final concert and the length of the encore:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

1. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
   \[ 2x = 50 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

Thus, Elaina's usual concerts run for \( \boxed{25} \) minutes.

So, Micah sold 9 glasses and Mitchell sold 9 glasses.

Now, we calculate the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah:

Next, subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, there are 40 microphones that can be arranged in pairs.

Finally, divide the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs by 2 to find the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

answer:  To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Total petals for orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Total petals for daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of petals of the daisies and the total number of petals of the orchids:
- Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt costs half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:

\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Next, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily diet. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( x \). Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the total cost for the carrots is \( 2x \).

The total cost of the daily diet is the sum of the cost of the carrots, the cost of the salad, and the cost of the yogurt:

\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 11 - 9 \]

\[ 2x = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 per carrot.

Finally, determine the number of flowering plants:
\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} \times \$25/\text{hour} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10 \times 3 \times 25 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Car payment} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$750 - \$500 \]

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} + 5 = 7 \]

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Joseph's original number of notebooks as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, let's determine how many notebooks Martha has now after buying 5 more:

\[ \text{Martha's new notebooks} = 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Finally, we need to find how many more notebooks Martha now has than Joseph:

answer:  First, let's determine the amount of material needed for one small mask and one large mask.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Material for 20 small masks:
- 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards

Material for 8 large masks:
- 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

Total material needed:
- 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Daniel read:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel did not read any pages.

Total pages read by Daniel:
\[ 13 + 0 = 13 \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:

Next, add this additional distance to the distance Dijana rowed to find the total distance Anis rowed:
\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, add the distances Dijana and Anis rowed to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

First, let's determine the total number of bowls needed:
- Adults: 1 adult (Calvin) + 1 adult (wife) = 2
- Children: 2

Total bowls needed = 2 adults + 2 children = 4 bowls

Calvin has enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he needs 4 adult bowls, he has enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

Since he needs 4 adult bowls, he has enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. 

He has enough soup for 8 child bowls. Since he needs 4 adult bowls, the remaining soup will be enough soup for 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls.

Each child will have 4 child bowls, so each child will be able to have a bowl of soup 2 times from the leftover soup.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times from the leftover soup.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost of notebooks: \$7.50
- Total cost of ballpen: \$0.50

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:

\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, they bought 12 balloons. The cost of 2 balloons is $0.5, so the cost of 1 balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.

Next, add the cost of the cake and the balloons to find the total amount spent on these items: $11 + $3 = $14.

Then, add the cost of the ice cream to find the total amount spent: $14 + (2 * $7) = $14 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowances and spent $28, the total amount of money they had initially was $28 + $28 = $56.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received: $56 / 2 = $28.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $28 in allowance.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cups Lana has:
\[ 27 \text{ cups} \]

She divides these 27 cups into 3 rows:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per row} \]
So, each row has 9 cups.

Next, we know that she uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups left for chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, and there are 3 rows, each row must have:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups of chamomile and mint tea per row} \]

Since each row has 9 cups in total and 4 of them are chamomile and mint tea combined, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:
\[ 9 - 4 = 5 \text{ cups per row} \]

Therefore, there are 5 cups of mint tea in each row.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, he has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) dogs.
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, he has \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) rabbits.
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, he has \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) fish.
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has \( \frac{1}{3} \) the number of fish he has. Therefore, he has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7 \) gerbils.

answer:  To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed per day by both Abby and Josh.

1. Abby eats 2 slices a day.
2. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Now, add the number of slices eaten by both Abby and Josh per day:
\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day} \]

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the bread will last, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices eaten per day:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

answer:  To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate the total number of trips he needs to make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours to make one trip, we divide the total time by the time it takes for one trip:

\[
text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we know the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total. To find out how many berries he can pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, is \boxed{12} berries.

\[ \text{Initial water in the tank} = \frac{10000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used over 6 days. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be \boxed{2000} gallons of water remaining in the tank.

answer:  To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of years she has been collecting shells and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

1. Calculate the number of years Martha has been collecting shells:
   - She started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.
   - She will be 10 years old on her 10th birthday.
   - Therefore, she has been collecting shells for \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) years.

2. Calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, for 5 years, she has been collecting shells for \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) months.

3. Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells.
   - Therefore, she will have collected 60 shells.

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

answer:  Let's denote the age of Jean as \( J \).

According to the problem, Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).

Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

\[ 4J = 80 \]

\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old. Now, we can find Peter's age:

\[ \text{Peter's age} = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5) to find the average:

He has also seen 8 movies on other days, which cost 8 * $7 = $56.
He has bought 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost 2 * $8 = $16.
He has bought 4 boxes of candy, which cost 4 * $2 = $8.
So far, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.
Colby wants to see a movie and buy popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.
He has $150 to spend in total, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.
Since he wants to see a movie and buy popcorn and a box of candy, he has $20 - $20 = $0 left to spend on a movie ticket.
The cost of a movie ticket is $10, so he can see an additional $0 / $10 = 0 movie.

answer:  To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between the distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles
- Distance traveled by the car: 240 miles
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 660 miles

Therefore, the bus went 660 miles farther than the car.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, the Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.
Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * $6 = $259200.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 * $6 = $194400.

1. Determine the total number of toys Sophie already has.
2. Determine the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls.
3. Subtract the initial number of toys from the total number of toys to find the number of bouncy balls.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie already has:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Total initial toys = 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Next, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, the total number of toys is 62. So, we can set up the following equation:

Total initial toys + Number of bouncy balls = Total toys

48 + Number of bouncy balls = 62

To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract 48 from 62:

Number of bouncy balls = 62 - 48 = 14

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students. Each student receives 2 bottles, and there are 29 pupils in the class.

\[ 29 \text{ pupils} \times 2 \text{ bottles/pupil} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemed to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

answer:  First, calculate John's total earnings for the week:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = <<50*6=300>>300 dollars

Next, subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars = <<300-50-100=150>>150 dollars

Now, calculate the cost of the 5 pencils:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = <<5*10=50>>50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = <<150-50=100>>100 dollars

Finally, determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = <<100/25=4>>4 pens

So, John can buy 4 25 dollar pens after spending his remaining money on gas and buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.

answer:  To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. Earnings from yams:
   - Number of yams: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. Earnings from sweet potatoes:
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. Earnings from carrots:
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = 9 + 20 + 5 = 34

Therefore, Jen will earn a total of $34.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance James swims:
He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
His swimming speed is 2 miles per hour, so the time it takes to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance:
The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

He swims this remaining distance at half his speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
The time it takes to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Finally, let's add up the total time:
Swimming time: 6 hours
Resting time: 3 hours
Swimming the remaining distance: 8 hours

Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

answer:  To determine the total charge for Patty's plumbing service, we need to calculate the cost of the initial visit, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. **Initial Visit Charge:**
   Patty charges $40 to visit the house.

2. **Labor Cost:**
   Patty charges $35 per hour for labor. The job took 2.25 hours.
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75
   \]

3. **Cost of Parts:**
   Patty charges $60 for parts.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total charge:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Initial Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Cost of Parts}
\]
\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 78.75 + 60
\]
\[
\text{Total Charge} = 178.75
\]

Therefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the job.

answer:  To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the dimensions of the pages.

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. The paper is printed at 100 pages per inch.
3. Each paper is printed on both sides, so each sheet of paper contains 2 pages.

First, calculate the total number of sheets of paper in the book:
\[ \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Thickness of the book}}{\text{Pages per inch}} = \frac{1.5 \text{ inches}}{100 \text{ pages/inch}} = 0.015 \text{ sheets} \]

Since each sheet contains 2 pages, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Number of sheets} \times \text{Pages per sheet} = 0.015 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 0.03 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book contains \(\boxed{0.3}\) pages.

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Commission per copy = $5 * 0.10 = $0.50
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = $0.50/copy * 6 copies = $3

Next, calculate the total commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Commission per copy = $15 * 0.08 = $1.20
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = $1.20/copy * 10 copies = $12

Finally, add the commissions from both types of newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

answer:  First, we need to determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 \]
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Let's denote Leo's age as \( L \).

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times L \]

To find \( L \), we solve for \( L \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 21 \times 2 = L \]
\[ L = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

1. Identify the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result of step 2 to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given:
- Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
- The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]
3. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves. So, we subtract 40 from 490:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is \boxed{450}.

answer:  The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

So, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

answer:  To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time intervals he spent stapling and then multiply that by the number of reports he can staple per interval.

First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 3 hours.
- Since each hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 180 minutes:
- 180 minutes divided by 15 minutes per interval is \(180 \div 15 = 12\) intervals.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 12 intervals, he can staple:
- 12 intervals multiplied by 30 reports per interval is \(12 \times 30 = 360\) reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 360 reports altogether from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
From 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. is 2 hours.
So, Kim usually sleeps for a total of 8 + 2 = 10 hours.
On that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 2 hours and 23 minutes.
From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 2 hours and 23 minutes.
So, she was sleepwalking for a total of 2 * 60 + 23 = 143 minutes.
Therefore, she slept on her bed for a total of 600 - 143 = 457 minutes.

- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points contributed by the team is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Given:
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.

Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so:
\[ Jason = 2J \]
\[ 2 = 2J \]
\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

Next, we know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason:
\[ Jordan = 2 \times Jordan \]
\[ 4 = 2 \times 2 \]

This confirms that Jordan carried 4 balls.

Now, we sum up the balls carried by all three boys:
\[ Total = Jordan + Jason + Jeffrey \]
\[ Total = 4 + 2 + 1 \]
\[ Total = 7 \]

First, let's find the number of non-work emails:
- Total emails sent per day: 16
- Work emails: 7
- Non-work emails: 16 - 7 = 9

Next, we calculate how many of these non-work emails are to family:
- Two-thirds of non-work emails are to family.
- Emails to family: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \)

Now, we determine the number of emails sent to her boyfriend:
- The remaining emails after sending to family are to her boyfriend.
- Remaining emails after sending to family: 9 - 6 = 3

- One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend.
- Emails to boyfriend: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \)

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend per day.

2. Subtract the number of measuring spoons he gifts to Pedro.
3. Add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups.

First, let's calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups (which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) cups), the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[

According to the problem:
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day:

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes from the first three days from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 40 - 31 \]
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 9 \]

\[ \text{Collins's corn chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the amounts received by each person:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = \text{Amora's corn chips} + \text{Lainey's corn chips} + \text{Collins's corn chips} \]
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

2. Calculate the total duration of each episode.
3. Multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode to find the total time.

First, let's find the number of episodes:

answer:  To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and then add it to the cost of the supplies.

1. **Calculate the cost of the tickets:**
   - The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
   - The cost of the supplies is $400.
   - To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.50:
     \[
     400 \times 0.50 = 200
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the tickets is:
     \[
     400 + 200 = 600
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the travel:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets:
     \[
     400 + 600 = 1000
     \]

So, the total cost of Jen's travel is $1000.

answer:  To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = P \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

answer:  John decides to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which means he is buying a total of 4 phones.

The first two phones are at the full price of $600 each:
\[ 2 \text{ phones} \times \$600/\text{phone} = \$1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price. The price of each phone at half price is half of $600:
\[ \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

So, the cost for the remaining two phones is:
\[ 2 \text{ phones} \times \$300/\text{phone} = \$600 \]

To find the total cost for all four phones, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining two phones:
\[ \$1200 + \$600 = \$1800 \]

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had:

1. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. Her office sent her 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

So, Greta had a total of 66 brownies.

Next, let's determine the number of brownies eaten during the party:

1. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the number of brownies left over:

1. Total brownies: 66
2. Brownies eaten: 18

Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as \( R \) and the number of cherries Jerry has as \( J \).

Given:
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
- The total number of cherries is 60.

From the information given:
\[ R + 10 = 30 \]
\[ R = 30 - 10 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Now, we know Richard has 20 cherries.

The total number of cherries is the sum of the cherries each person has:
\[ R + J + 30 = 60 \]
\[ 20 + J + 30 = 60 \]
\[ 50 + J = 60 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ \text{Dad's age when Emil is 24} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ \text{Brother's age when Emil is 24} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Next, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is currently 19 years old, we can calculate the current ages as follows:
\[ \text{Dad's current age} = 48 - 19 = 29 \]
\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 12 - 19 = 7 \]

Finally, we find the sum of their current ages:

answer:  To determine the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:

1. **Cost of petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Katherine wants 3 petunias.
   - Total cost for petunias = \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of sweet potato vines:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = \( 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for one basket:**
   - Total cost for one basket = \( 9 + 5 = 14 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 baskets:

- Total cost for 5 baskets = \( 5 \times 14 = 70 \) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

answer:  To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father.
2. Subtract the total amount received from his mother and father from the total cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

- His mother gave him $6.
- His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, Adam received $18 from his mother and father.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:

The total cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Thus, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

answer:  To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill check**: Once per month.
   - For a year: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year.

2. **Gas bill check**: Once per month.
   - For a year: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year.

3. **Church check**: Twice per month.
   - For a year: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year.

4. **Pest and lawn service check**: Quarterly.
   - For a year: 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 3 checks/year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 3 checks

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 3 = 51 checks

answer:  Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

Given:
- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, which means \( \frac{1}{4}F \) for each of them.
- The other plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout the day.

So, the total number of flights the second plane makes in one day is 44.

According to the problem, the second plane's 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout the day. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{F}{2} \ = 44 \]

To find \( F \), we solve for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 \]
\[ F = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes \( \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \) flights to France.

answer:  First, calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner:
- On low mode: 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees
- On high mode: 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

Total cooling effect = 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Next, calculate the total warming effect of the room when the air conditioner is off:
- Room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
- Air conditioner was off for 2 hours.

Total warming effect = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, calculate the net change in temperature:
- Net change = Total cooling effect - Total warming effect
- Net change = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. Since the starting temperature is not specified, we can express the final temperature in terms of the starting temperature:
- Final temperature = Starting temperature - Net change
- Final temperature = Starting temperature - 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

answer:  First, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ adults} \times 2x \text{ (adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ kids} \times x \text{ (kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the watermelon is divided into a total of 8 slices (assuming the watermelon is divided into 8 equal slices for simplicity), the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \text{Percentage per adult} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ adults} \times 2x \text{ (adult's slice)}}{8 \text{ slices}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{4x}{8} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

- Akbar's age: 3
- Alessandro's age: 4
- Total age of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as \( A \). Since the total age of the children is 20, the average age \( A \) is:
\[ A = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's find the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
- Total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene: 7 + 10 = 17

Finally, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the children:

2. Appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time for tasks = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Next, let's convert the total time for tasks into hours:

480 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours

Now, let's subtract the time spent on tasks from the total time spent at the clinic:

Total time spent at the clinic = 9 hours
Time spent on tasks = 8 hours

Time left for updating records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Since Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 180 minutes from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 180 minutes = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm minus 180 minutes, which is 2:00 pm - 3 hours = 1:00 am the next morning of the next day.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box:

Distance Matteo traveled = Speed × Time
Distance Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance Matteo = 220 miles

Next, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:

Distance Shandy traveled = Speed × Time
Distance Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance Shandy = 450 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
Difference in distance = Distance Shandy - Distance Matteo
Difference in distance = 450 miles - 220 miles

   - Therefore, Shaelyn can run \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) laps.

4. **Quinn:**
   - Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
   - Therefore, Quinn can run \( 7 - 2 = 5 \) laps.

Now, we find the difference between the number of laps Bethany can run and the number of laps Quinn can run:

\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \text{ laps} - 5 \text{ laps} = 5 \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

answer:  To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 three times.

1. **First Year:**
   - Initial Price: $120
   - Increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New Price: $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Initial Price: $126
   - Increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New Price: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Initial Price: $132.30
   - Increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 ≈ $6.61
   - New Price: $132.30 + $6.61 ≈ $139

answer:  To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pictures in each album.
2. Determine the number of selfies and portraits based on the given albums.

First, let's find out how many pictures are in each album. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 of the albums contain selfies only and 2 albums contain portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits as follows:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to find the total number of pictures:

\[ \text{Total number of pictures} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits in total.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.5/peach = $1
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.5/pei = $2
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1/kiwi = $2
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Total cost of these fruits:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $8.75

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount is:
$10 - $8.75 = $1.25

To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $1.25, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum:
$1.25 / $0.25/plum = 5 plums

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 5 plums.

answer:  To determine how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages of his book. We know that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.

First, let's find out how many pages James can read in 1 minute. If he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then in 1 minute he reads:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. If he reads \(\frac{3}{10}\) pages per minute, then to read 18 pages he will take:

\[ \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ pages per minute}} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

answer:  To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the cost per sandwich based on the given packages.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 per sandwich

2. Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 sandwiches = $<<6/4=1.5>>1.5 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional to the number of sandwiches, we can assume that the cost per sandwich is consistent across all packages.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:

- Cost per sandwich = $1.5
- Number of sandwiches = 8

Total cost = Cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
Total cost = $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

answer:  Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as \( x \).

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of large stuffed animals she sold is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the revenue from small stuffed animals is \( 4x \).

Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars. Therefore, the revenue from large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times \frac{x}{2} = 6x \).

The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is:
\[ 4x + 6x = 10x \]

We know that the total revenue is $120, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 10x = 120 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{10} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

1. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
2. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

1. **Probability of a substitute teacher:** 50%
2. **Probability of the teacher giving an extension:** 40%
3. **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension:** 20%

First, let's calculate the combined probability of all these scenarios happening:

- Probability of a substitute teacher: 50%
- Probability of the teacher giving an extension: 40%
- Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20%

Combined probability = 50% * 40% * 20% = 4%

This means there is a 4% chance that Marcus will avoid turning in his homework.

To find the probability that he will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this probability from 100%:

Probability of having to turn in homework = 100% - 4% = 96%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 96%.

answer:  To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the post office delivered **736 letters** from Monday to Wednesday.

answer:  To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- Number of people wanting the chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for the chicken salad: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $65.00

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting the pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for the pasta salad: $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6.00/person = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total cost for the catering:
- Total cost = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, Molly will pay **101.00** for the catering.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of money Jim receives in loans while in college: $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

Next, determine how much money Jim lost by not working during those 4 years. Since he earned $25,000 per year before college, he lost: $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

Now, calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new annual income is: $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

Finally, calculate how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new annual income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn back the equivalent amount.

answer:  Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, which is \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3x + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Rory retrieved 5 tennis balls in the second set. In the first set, he retrieved:
\[ x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 9 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

answer:  Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

The total amount of $1920 is the sum of the shares of the three people:
\[ x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

answer:  To determine the average amount Johnny's dad lost or won, we need to calculate the total amount lost or won and then divide by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. Since he lost $5, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost or won:
- Total lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50
- Total won: $11

Net amount lost: $21.50 - $11 = $0.50

Since there are 3 races, the average amount lost per race is:
- Average net amount lost per race: $0.50 / 3 races ≈ $0.17

answer:  To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
- Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
- Over 30 days, she drinks:
  \[
  8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon:
- To find the number of gallons, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

1. Initial price in 2007: $20000
2. Depreciation rate: 21% per year

For the first year (2008):
- Depreciation: $20000 * 21% = $4200
- Price in 2009: $20000 - $4200 = $15800

For the second year (2009):
- Depreciation: $15800 * 21% = $3318
- Price in 2010: $15800 - $3318 = $12482

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $12482.

answer:  To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters in 3 weeks.
2. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters in 3 weeks:

- There are 8 hours in a day.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, in 3 weeks, there are \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- The team worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day, which is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 8 = 3\) hours per day.
- So, the total number of hours worked in 3 weeks is \(3 \times 21 = 63\) hours.

Next, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:

- There are 4 painters.
- Therefore, the number of hours each painter worked is \(\frac{63}{4} = 15.75\) hours.

answer:  To determine how much James pays a year for his insurance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 per month.
- The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

Now, add this amount to the normal cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $192.

Next, to find the annual cost, multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

The final answer is:
\[ 2304 \]

answer:  To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by Imma's cats.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds each cat twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, each cat consumes:
\[ 2 \text{ meals/day} \times 60 \text{ grams/meal} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 120 \text{ grams/cat} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount consumed per day:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

answer:  Let's denote the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal was 58 minutes long.

answer:  To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday: \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday: \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, add these numbers together:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Calculate the total:

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247 classes.

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money Jenny has. Since she arrived with five $5 bills, she has:

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.
To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price.
The original price is $2000 and the selling price is $1800, so the difference is $2000 - $1800 = $200.
To find the percentage discount, we divide the difference by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%
Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is 10%.

The total amount of fence between Sam and Harry is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets:

\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

answer:  To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball was dropped.
2. Determine the height of the first bounce.
3. Determine the height of the second bounce.

1. **Initial Height:**
   - The ball was dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **First Bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height of the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

3. **Second Bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height of the first bounce.
   - So, the height of the second bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

Thus, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

answer:  To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum the distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first train:**
   - Speed of the first train: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second train:**
   - Speed of the second train: Half of the first train's speed, which is 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

3. **Total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance of the first train + Distance of the second train = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are **270 miles** apart from each other.

answer:  Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( T \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is \( \frac{T}{2} \).

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so the amount of meat after the velociraptors ate is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{4} \).

3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is the remaining amount. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{T}{4} = 270
   \]

4. To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   T = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \boxed{1080} kilograms.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each.

Next, let's find the total area of all four walls:

- There are two north and south walls, so 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.
- There are two east and west walls, so 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.
- Total area = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Now, let's determine how many gallons of paint are needed:

- Each gallon covers 20 square feet, so 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

- Each gallon costs $12, so 12 gallons cost 12 * $12 = $144.

answer:  To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest waterslide: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest waterslide: 80 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the second biggest Waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.

The answer is 2 minutes.

\[ 31 + 30 = 61 \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 61 = 12 \]

So, Billy takes 12 days off. This means he helps people on:

\[ 61 - 12 = 49 \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. Therefore, he can help:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Over the 49 days he works, he helps:

answer:  To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of people from the cars:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Total people from cars = 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

Next, let's calculate the number of people from the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Total people from buses = 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

Finally, we add the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses:
- Total people inside the church = 60 people (from cars) + 420 people (from buses) = 480 people.

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 480.

answer:  To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

1. Initially, there were 12 sodas.
2. Ellen shook 3 sodas, so there are 3 shaken sodas.
3. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so there are 8 unshaken sodas left.
4. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas left and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas left.

The total number of sodas left is 2 shaken sodas + 6 unshaken sodas = 8 sodas.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Likelihood} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} \]

answer:  Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( x \).

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

3. According to the problem, 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{15} = 6
   \]

4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15 = 90

2. Subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find Ahito's distance.

First, let's calculate the distance Micah ran:
Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = \text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find Ahito's distance:
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

answer:  To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. We know that 40% of the school population (which consists of boys) is equal to 240 boys.

Let \( P \) be the total school population. Then:

\[ 0.4P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.4} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600 students.

Next, we need to find the number of girls. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, the remaining 60% is made up of girls.

Let \( G \) be the number of girls. Then:

\[ 0.6P = G \]

Substituting \( P = 600 \):

\[ G = 0.6 \times 600 \]
\[ G = 360 \]

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

3. Dior did laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time spent by each person:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 8 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.

answer:  To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate the 20% increase of last year's enrollment and then add it to last year's enrollment.

Last year's enrollment was 50 students.

First, calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class.

answer:  To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can set up the equation:

\[ 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \times t \text{ minutes} = 459 \text{ blinks} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ t = \frac{459}{51} \]

\[ t \approx 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

1. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
2. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}

answer:  To determine how many miles John drives when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance John drives to his parents' house.
2. Calculate the distance he drives back home.
3. Multiply the total distance by the number of times he visits each month.

First, let's calculate the distance John drives to his parents' house:
- It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance he drives back home:
- The distance back home is the same as the distance to his parents' house, which is 140 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance per month:
- John visits his parents twice a month.
- Total distance per month = Distance to parents' house + Distance back home × Number of visits
- Total distance per month = 140 miles + 140 miles × 2 visits/month = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.

answer:  To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days.
2. Use the information given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days to find Brian's distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days:
Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days.
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days. Let \( B \) be the distance Brian will walk in seven days.
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is \( \frac{S}{2} \) and \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers initially.

Since Luis gave Kris \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, and we know Kris had 16 stickers initially, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

- The 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Together, the first four workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

In a 10-hour shift, they produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

After the 10-hour shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced \(200 + 20 = 220\) toys in the 10-hour shift.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: \(220 \div 10 = 22\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 22 toys per hour.

\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 18 = 2V \]

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + A + C + S = 56 \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)
3. \( C = S + 12 \)

Substitute \( C \) in the second equation:

\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) in the third equation:
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, \( A = A \). Therefore, \( A = 9 \).

Now, find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 9 = 12 \]

   - She walks for 40 minutes on the beach.

2. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**

Now, we need to find out the cost per single bagel after the discount. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:

Since Donny can drink the water if it is at least 40 degrees, we set up the inequality:

\[

Next, we subtract 33 from both sides:

\[
x \geq 167

Thus, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 167 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 167 degrees.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:

Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ 240 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add them to the initial count.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added over three weeks:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 20 * 7 = 140 cows added.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added over three weeks:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 10 * 7 = 70 chickens added.

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the added numbers:
- Initial cows: 50
- Initial chickens: 20
- Added cows: 140
- Added chickens: 70

Total number of animals after three weeks = 50 + 20 + 140 + 70 = 280 animals.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

Let \( M \) be the number of men and \( W \) be the number of women.

The ratio of men to women can be written as:
\[ \frac{M}{W} = \frac{5}{9} \]

The total number of passengers is:
\[ M + W = 84 \]

We can express \( M \) in terms of \( W \) using the ratio:
\[ M = \frac{5}{9}W \]

Substitute \( M \) into the total passenger equation:
\[ \frac{5}{9}W + W = 84 \]
\[ \frac{14}{9}W = 84 \]
\[ W = 54 \]

So, there are 54 women on the bus initially.

After 20 women alight, the number of women remaining is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

answer:  First, let's determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. We know he earns $26 from sunflowers and $56 from $8 bouquets per day.

The total earnings from sunflowers are $26, and each sunflower costs $2:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

The total earnings from bouquets are $56, and each bouquet costs $8:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 7 \times 12 = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So Faraday sold 291 sunflowers.

answer:  To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- He then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- He took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles.
- He took 3 hours to travel the additional 140 miles.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours

Average speed = 50 miles per hour

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

2. Calculate the number of red jelly beans.
3. Determine the total number of green and red jelly beans.
4. Subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans to find the number of blue jelly beans.

1. The number of green jelly beans is given as 17.
2. The number of red jelly beans is twice the number of green jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \(2 \times 17 = 34\).
3. The total number of green and red jelly beans is the sum of the green and red jelly beans, which is \(17 + 34 = 51\).
4. The total number of jelly beans is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Now, add the lengths of both songs to find the total duration:

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters, for $30. So, he had 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. Therefore, he sold 30 square meters at $3 per square meter, which is 30 * $3 = $90.

To find out how much money he earned in total, we add up all the amounts:

answer:  To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we first need to calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.

Since each juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need to cover 100% of the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.

Total daily energy demand for 2300 people = 2300 people * 100% = 23000 units

Each juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, so 1 juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand.

To cover 23000 units, we need 23000 units / 20% = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day, they need to produce an additional 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

answer:  To determine Geb's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Haley's age.
2. Calculate half of Haley's age.
3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age.

Given:
- Haley's age is 26 years.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Haley's age = 26 years.
2. Half of Haley's age = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) years.
3. Geb's age = \( 13 - 10 = 3 \) years.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + (B + 7) + 4B = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

answer:  Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's denote the amount given to their little sister as \(x\).

Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money, so she has \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\) dollars left.

The total amount of money Rissa had initially is $15, so she gave \(15 - 12 = 3\) dollars to her little sister.

Since both Rissa and Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars to his little sister.

After giving 3 dollars to his little sister, Ronnie is left with \(5 - 3 = 2\) dollars.

Therefore, Ronnie is left with $2.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Next, let's calculate the number of goals scored by each team in the second half:
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores (1/4) * 8 = 2 goals.
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's sum up the total number of goals scored by both teams:
- Team A: 4 goals (first half) + 2 goals (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 goals (first half) + 8 goals (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 goals from team A + 10 goals from team B = 16 goals.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ \text{Number of pods in the special size box} = 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per pod for the special size box. The special size box costs $12, and it contains 120 pods.

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod and each pod costs $0.10, the number of cycles that can be run for $1 is:

\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

1. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist.
2. Determine the total number of teeth James has.
3. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed.

First, let's find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:
- The dentist drills 4 teeth.
- The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) teeth.

Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Next, we know that James has 30 teeth in total.

Now, we calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

answer:  Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint used as \( x \) pints each. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of paint used for these three colors is \( 3x \) pints.

The problem states that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint, which is given as 12 pints. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3x = 6 \]
\[ x = \frac{6}{3} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( x \) pints, which is 2 pints.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \( \boxed{2} \] pints.

So, the amount of chalk left after Monday is:

Now, the teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The teacher needs to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Therefore, the number of days he can use the remaining chalk is:

We also know that in 25 years, Wendy will be a third as old as Wendy is now. Therefore, in 25 years, Wendy's age will be:
\[ 5(C + 7) + 25 = 5C + 32 \]

In 25 years, Wendy will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so:
\[ 5C + 32 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5C + 32 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 5C + 32 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5C + 32 \]

answer:  Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, so in 60 minutes, he can build 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.
However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/3 snowballs per minute.
To find out how long it will take before Jay has 60 snowballs, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs added per minute.
The net number of snowballs added per minute is:

1/3 snowballs per minute - 2/3 snowballs per minute = -1/3 snowballs per minute.
This means Jay loses 1/3 snowballs per minute.
To find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the total number of snowballs by the net number of snowballs added per minute:

60 snowballs / (1/3 snowballs per minute) = 180 minutes.

Weekly earnings = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = $67.5/week

Next, calculate her monthly earnings for April:
- There are 4 weeks in April.

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * 4 weeks
Monthly earnings = $67.5/week * 4 weeks
Monthly earnings = $270

Finally, add the additional $10 for complete attendance:
- She receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.

Total earnings = Monthly earnings + Additional pay
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

Therefore, Jen will receive $280 for her complete attendance and her regular pay for the 4 weeks in April.

1. **Initial amount of root beer**: 24 gallons

2. **First day**:
   - Fred's children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons

3. **Second day**:
   - Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons

4. **Third day**:
   - Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons

5. **Fourth day**:
   - There are 3 people at the party.
   - The remaining root beer is shared equally among the 3 people.
   - Each person gets: \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons

So, each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons of root beer.

To express this as a decimal:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \]

Each person gets approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

answer:  Let's denote the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day as \( x \).

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they had \( (x + 12) - 10 = x + 22 \) bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages. So, they had \( (x + 22) - 25 = x - 3 \) bandages left.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore, \( x - 3 = 78 \).

Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 81 \]

So, they started with 81 bandages on the first day.

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \).

Next, let's determine the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) packs of black pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

Finally, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
- Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
- Total number of pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens

Alain has 75 pens in total.

answer:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600/10 = $<<600/10=60>>60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 bottles.

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60*0.5) = $<<60+(60*0.5)=90>>90.

The total cost for the scotch is 10 bottles * $60 = $<<10*60=600>>600.

The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $<<20*90=1800>>1800.

The total cost for everything is $600 + $1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400.

answer:  Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. Therefore, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. Therefore, the height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house has two floors, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the sum of the height of the second floor and the height of the first floor:

\[ 240 + 180 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood per whale} \]
\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of blood for ten sharks. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, the total amount of blood for ten sharks is:

\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood per shark} \]
\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea together have 1200 gallons of blood.

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can write this relationship as an equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
   \[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are remaining after accounting for the fish with red stripes. Since there are 66 fish in total and 22 of them have red stripes, the number of remaining fish is:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we add the number of trees planted on each day:

On the first day: 20 White Oak trees + 40 Lodgepole Pine trees = 60 trees.
On the second day: 30 White Oak trees + 50 Lodgepole Pine trees = 80 trees.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 trees (first day) + 80 trees (second day) = 140 trees.

The first dog walks 1 mile.
The second dog walks 4 miles.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that the average number of miles walked by all four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total number of miles walked by all four dogs should be:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of miles walked by the first three dogs from the total number of miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

answer:  For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum three times a year at a cost of $2 per visit. Therefore, in the first 5 years, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} \times \$2 \text{ per visit} = \$30 \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%, which means each visit now costs:

\[ \$2 \times 3.50 = \$7 \]

Pauline continues to visit the museum for 3 more years at the increased price. Therefore, in the next 3 years, she spends:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} \times \$7 \text{ per visit} = \$63 \]

To find the total amount Pauline spent over all the years, we add the amount from the first 5 years and the amount from the next 3 years:

\[ \$30 + \$63 = \$93 \]

Therefore, Pauline spent \$93 on all visits to the museum.

answer:  To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. **First 16 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute is $0.25.
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes: \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Remaining 20 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute after 16 minutes is $0.2.
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes: \( 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of both segments to find the total cost of the 36-minute call:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for the first 16 minutes} + \text{Cost for the remaining 20 minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, a 36-minute call would cost $8.

answer:  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and Jordan has 2 children. Therefore, the total number of diaper changes needed per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ diaper changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes the remaining half of the diapers:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes/day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to this total length. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the length of the shorter piece, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.

To find the length of the longer piece, we multiply the length of the shorter piece by 4:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The answer is: \(\boxed{32}\)

answer:  To determine how much secret seasoning Aiden will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs.
2. Determine the amount of secret seasoning required for that amount of ground beef.

First, let's find out how much ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can calculate the amount of ground beef required by dividing the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Tablespoons of secret seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

answer:  To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of issues from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \]

Finally, let's calculate the number of issues from the last magazine, which sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the issues to find the total number of issues Susan receives every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \]

Since each magazine is a set of issues, we need to convert the total number of issues back into magazines. Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is:
\[ \text{Total number of magazines per year} = 6 \]

So, Susan gets 6 magazines every year.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies she makes is \( 3C - 2 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is \( C + (3C - 2) = 4C - 2 \).

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats distributed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 10 + 2 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled.

Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

- Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
- There are 80 classrooms.
- Total time per day = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes.

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task:

- Total time for all days = 1200 minutes/day * 5 days = 6000 minutes.

Next, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours:

- Total time in hours = 6000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms:

- The custodian works an 8-hour day.
- Total time spent cleaning = 10 hours.

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (Total time spent cleaning / Total work hours) * 100
= (10 hours / 8 hours) * 100

2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. So, her brother used \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.
3. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) grapes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of grapes used by all of them:
- Madeline used 6 grapes.
- Her brother used 30 grapes.
- Their mother used 48 grapes.

Total grapes used = \( 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \) grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother, the total number of grapes at the beginning must be 84.

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \( 84 \).

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year.

According to the problem, Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{3}{4}x \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

\[ 12 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

\[ 4 = 12 \]

- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.
- Each dozen contains 12 eggs, so 5 dozens contain 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.
- The total cost for 60 eggs is 60 * $2.40 = $144.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many groups of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3: 60 / 3 = 20 groups.
- Since each group is sold for $1, the total revenue is 20 * $1 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
- Total revenue = $20
- Total cost = $144
- Profit = $20 - $144 = -$124

Therefore, Rose's profit is a loss of $124.

answer:  First, let's calculate the number of questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 70 = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

So, Audrey correctly answered 42 questions on the first test.

Next, let's determine the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to achieve a 70% percentage on both tests combined. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To get 70% of the total questions correct, she needs:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total.

Since she already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

answer:  To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down his weekly costs and then extend that to a yearly total.

1. **Weekly Costs:**
   - Pasta: $1.00 per box
   - Cheddar Cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere Cheese: Twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so \(2 \times 3.00 = $6.00\)

   Total weekly cost:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. **Yearly Costs:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Bud spends $10.00 per week.

   Total yearly cost:
   \[
   10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
   \]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for the blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes \( 96 \) blueberry cubes.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum them up.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The third side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. The fifth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 2.5 \text{ minutes} + 2.5 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

1. Calculate the number of red hats.
2. Determine the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats.
3. Calculate the number of blue hats.
4. Determine the number of white hats.

First, let's find the number of red hats:
\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Next, we calculate the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:
\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Then, we determine the number of blue hats:
\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Finally, we find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:
\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of flashlights:
- Each person has 1 flashlight, and there are 4 people.
- Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms.

Total flashlights = 4 people * 2 flashlights/room * 8 rooms = 64 flashlights

Next, calculate the total number of candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.
- There are 8 rooms in total, so half of them is 8/2 = 4 rooms.

Small candles = 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles
Medium candles = 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles

Total candles = 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Finally, calculate the total number of candles and flashlights:
- Total flashlights = 64 flashlights
- Total candles = 36 candles

Total candles and flashlights = 64 flashlights + 36 candles = 100 light items

According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \).

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The cost of the main phone is given as $20. Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:

We know that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the whole phone plan:

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500}{375} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages of text at his increased speaking speed.

answer:  To determine how far Elvis is from his house now, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point:
- Distance = √((Distance west)^2 + (Distance east)^2)
- Distance = √(90^2 + 144^2)
- Distance = √(8100 + 20736)
- Distance = √28836
- Distance = 170 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 170 miles from his house now.

answer:  To determine the force needed to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of the two children: 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. Therefore, we calculate:

Force needed = 1% of Total weight
Force needed = (1/100) * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

answer:  First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Total daily consumption for German Shepherds = 2 kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Total daily consumption for Bulldogs = 3 kilograms dog food/Bulldog * 2 Bulldog = 6 kilograms.

Now, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
- Total daily consumption = Daily consumption for German Shepherds + Daily consumption for Bulldogs
- Total daily consumption = 5 kilograms + 6 kilograms = 11 kilograms.

Next, let's calculate the weekly dog food consumption:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total weekly consumption = Total daily consumption * 7 days
- Total weekly consumption = 11 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 77 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 77 kilograms of dog food in a week.

answer:  To determine the total cost Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Hotel Stay Cost:**
   - Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Total cost for the hotel stay = \( 3 nights * $80/night = $240 \).

2. **Bus Trip Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip = \( 0.10 * $80 = $8 \).
   - Total cost for the bus trips = \( 7 trips * $8/trip = $56 \).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the hotel stay + Cost of the bus trips
   - Total cost = $240 + $56 = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 in total for her trip.

answer:  To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Dallas initially had.
2. Determine the total number of marbles Mazie had initially.
3. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had initially to find out how many marbles Darla received.

First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dallas initially had. We know that after dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has 21 marbles left. Therefore, the total number of marbles Dallas initially had is:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles in total and gave them to Dallas and Darla. Since Dallas received 25 marbles, the total number of marbles Mazie had initially is:
\[ 52 \]

Now, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had initially to find out how many marbles Darla received:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

1. **First Year:**
   - Depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700
   - Value after first year: $9000 - $2700 = $6300

2. **Second Year:**
   - Depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890
   - Value after second year: $6300 - $1890 = $4410

3. **Third Year:**
   - Depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882
   - Value after third year: $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, the value of the boat after the three years is $3528.

\[ \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Emma's age} = 40 + 16 \]
\[ \text{Emma's age} = 56 \]

Next, we calculate the sum of their ages:

\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age} \]
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = 40 + 56 \]
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = 96 \]

Finally, we find the average by dividing the sum of their ages by 2:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of ages}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

The average of their ages is 48.

1. There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
   - Total age of sisters = 3 sisters * 16 years/sister = 48 years.

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.
   - Let's denote the age of the older brother as \( B \).
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{B}{2} = 12 \).
   - Solving for \( B \): \( B = 12 \times 2 = 24 \).
   - Therefore, the older brother is 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:

- Total age of sisters = 48 years
- Total age of brothers = 12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 36 years

Total age of all siblings = 48 years (sisters) + 36 years (brothers) = 84 years.

answer:  To determine how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week.
2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars.

First, let's find the number of chocolate bars produced in one week:
- The company produces 5000 bars per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in one week, the company produces \( 5000 \times 7 = 35000 \) bars.

Next, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks:
- In two weeks, the company produces \( 35000 \times 2 = 70000 \) bars.

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these bars:
- Each bar is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 70000 \times 2 = 140000 \) dollars.

The company will receive $140000.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for 2 people, so $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Next, let's determine how much money Janet had initially:

- Her parents gave her $40.

So, Janet had $40 initially.

Now, let's calculate how much money Janet has left:

Amount left = Initial amount - Total spent
Amount left = $40 - $27.00
Amount left = $13.00

Therefore, Janet has $13.00 left.

answer:  First, calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12 seeds, we have:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, add this to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to find the total number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, add the number of seeds in the small sunflower to the number of seeds in the large sunflower to find the total number of sunflower seeds:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

\[ 90 \text{ seeds} \]

answer:  First, calculate the cost of each ingredient for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Next, calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
- Total cost for 10 jars = $44/jar * 10 jars = $440

Then, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
- Total revenue = $50/jar * 10 jars = $500

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost for 10 jars
- Profit = $500 - $440
- Profit = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars of the jam mixture.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
\[6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\]

Next, let's determine how many holes are left when Nate gets home:
\[84 \text{ holes}\]

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled in each day is:
\[9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}\]

To find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in each day:
\[\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}\]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[28 \text{ days} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 4 \text{ weeks}\]

answer:  To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings for 2 weeks.

1. There are 7 days in a week, and Josh is closed on Sunday and Wednesday. Therefore, he is open for 7 - 2 = 5 days in a week.

2. Josh services 3 cars a day. So, in a week, he services 3 cars * 5 days = 15 cars.

3. He gets paid $4 per car. Therefore, his weekly earnings are 15 cars * $4/car = $60.

4. To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since the deal is buy one get one 50% off, he will only pay for one T-shirt at full price. Therefore, he will pay $8 for one T-shirt.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. A 40% discount means he will pay 60% of the original price. To find 60% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.60:

\[ 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \]

So, Jake pays $24 for the shoes.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirt and the cost of the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \(\boxed{32}\).

1. Calculate the total number of screws needed for 4 tables.
2. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.

First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for 4 tables:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Each leg needs 2 screws.

So, the total number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James has 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

answer:  To determine how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Vanessa ran.
2. Determine the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds.
3. Calculate the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race.

First, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles and that she ran twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, Aaron ran:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's running speed is half of Aaron's running speed. Therefore, Vanessa's running speed is:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, it will take her:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took \( 32 \) minutes to complete her part of the race.

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From these, we can write the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

answer:  First, let's determine the current ages of James and Dora.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) years old.
2. James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) years old.

Next, let's determine John's current age.

1. John had James when he was 19, so James is \( 19 + 18 = 37 \) years old.
2. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is \( 37 - 32 = 5 \) years old.

Now, let's determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

1. John's youngest son is currently 5 years old.
2. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) years old.

So, John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32, will be 8 years old in 3 years.

answer:  To determine how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the pizzas.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas.

First, let's find the total number of slices:
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- There are 7 pizzas.

So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas:
- Henry has 3 friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ friends} = 4 \text{ people} \]

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
