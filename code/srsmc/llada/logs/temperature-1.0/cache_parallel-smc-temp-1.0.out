answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James runs in one day.
James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters long.
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the distance James runs in one week.
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1260 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is \(\boxed{1260}\) meters.

answer:  To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

The amount of blue fiber is given as 2 bolts.
The amount of white fiber is half of the blue fiber, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue fiber)} + 1 \text{ (white fiber)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

answer:  To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.
2. Calculate the new value of the house after the 150% increase.
3. Determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.

1. The total cost of the house after repairs is:
   \[
   \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
   \]

2. The new value of the house after a 150% increase is:
   \[
   \$80,000 + 1.50 \times \$80,000 = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
   \]

3. The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
   \[
   \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
   \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is \$70,000.

answer:  To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends.
3. Calculate the number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market.
4. Multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to find her daily earnings.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.
3. The number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.
4. She sells each egg for $2, so her daily earnings are 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

answer:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file.

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the restart to install updates:

40 minutes (first part) + 60 minutes (second part) + 20 minutes (restart) = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

answer:  To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to calculate the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, we add up the number of sheep from all three cities:

- Seattle: 20 sheep
- Charleston: 80 sheep
- Toulouse: 160 sheep

Total number of sheep = \( 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \)

Thus, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together.

The answer is \( \boxed{260} \).

answer:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of each type of glass and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. Therefore, the cost of each second glass is:
   \[
   0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which means he will buy 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each.

The cost for the 8 glasses at $5 each is:
\[
8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

The cost for the 8 glasses at $3 each is:
\[
8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[
40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64.

answer:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day.

Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed for the day is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we add up the feed given in the morning and afternoon meals:
- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

Total feed given so far:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

answer:  To find the total cost of Toula's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

3. **Cost of mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries:
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

answer:  To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads: 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - Downloads: Three times as many as the first month
   - Downloads: \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \)

3. **Third Month:**
   - Downloads: Reduced by 30% from the second month
   - Downloads: \( 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 \)

Now, we sum up the downloads for all three months:

\[ \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month} + \text{Second Month} + \text{Third Month} \]
\[ \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 \]
\[ \text{Total Downloads} = 366 \]

Therefore, the program had a total of 366 downloads.

answer:  Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours is $10, so she earns 40 * $10 = $<<40*10=400>>400 for the first 40 hours.
Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, so she worked 45 - 40 = <<45-40=5>>5 overtime hours.
Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $<<1.2*10=12>>12 per hour.
Therefore, she earns 5 * $12 = $<<5*12=60>>60 for the overtime hours.
Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460.

answer:  John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 miles.
He then spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.
He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 0.5 * 30 = <<0.5*30=15>>15 miles.
The remaining time of the 4 hours is 4 - 3 - 2 - 0.5 = <<4-3-2-0.5=0.5>>0.5 hours.
He drives this remaining time at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 0.5 * 80 = <<0.5*80=40>>40 miles.
In total, John has driven a distance of 180 + 15 + 40 = <<180+15+40=235>>235 miles from home.

answer:  To determine the potential profit from each purchase plan, we need to calculate the future value of each item after the market increase.

**Jewelry:**
- Current value: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- Future value: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

**Electronic Gadgets:**
- Current value: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- Future value: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

**Profit Calculation:**
- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the jewelry, as it yields a higher profit of $125.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for the contemporary dance students:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

answer:  Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \times \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners.
4. After these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so \( \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{6} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:

\[
x = 36
\]

So, Melanie started with \( 36 \) vacuum cleaners.

answer:  To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net income and expenses each year.

1. **Annual Income:**
   - The tree grows 7 lemons each year.
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   - Annual income from selling lemons = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.

2. **Annual Expenses:**
   - It costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree.

3. **Net Annual Income:**
   - Net annual income = Annual income - Annual expenses
   - Net annual income = $10 - $3 = $7

4. **Initial Cost:**
   - The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

5. **Years to Break Even:**
   - To break even, the net annual income must cover the initial cost.
   - Years to break even = Initial cost / Net annual income
   - Years to break even = $90 / $7/year ≈ 13 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years to start earning money from the lemon tree.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Then, calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

#### 7 dozens of eggs.

answer:  First, calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a teacher:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings as a teacher} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Next, calculate her weekly earnings as a cheerleading coach:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings as a coach} = 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Now, add her weekly earnings from both jobs to find her total weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$700/\text{week} + \$450/\text{week} = \$1150/\text{week} \]

Finally, calculate her annual salary by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ \text{Annual salary} = \$1150/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is \$57,500.

answer:  First, calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour for the next 2 miles.
- Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Next, determine the total distance Marissa needs to cover:
- The total trail is 12 miles.
- She has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
- Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, the total time should be:
- Total time = Total distance / Average speed
- Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Finally, calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
- Speed = Distance / Time
- Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at the remaining distance at 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

1. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs:
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

Now, we sum up the DVDs sold to all the customers:
\[
3 \text{ DVDs} + 4 \text{ DVDs} + 0 \text{ DVDs} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is:

1. Determine Samantha's current age.
2. Determine Raymond's current age based on the information given.
3. Calculate Raymond's age when he had his son.
4. Find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

1. Samantha is currently 31 years old.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
   \[
   31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's age when he had his son was:
   \[
   25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract Raymond's age when he had his son from his current age:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years ago}
   \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born \boxed{23 years ago}.

answer:  Let's denote Darrell's current age as \( 7x \) and Allen's current age as \( 11x \). According to the problem, their total age now is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 18:

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying \( x \) by 11:

\[ \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- 4 apples at $1.50 each: \( 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \)

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the pizza boxes is:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} \]

answer:  To find the original price of the book, we need to account for the 25% discount. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

The discount amount is 25% of the original price, which is \( 0.25P \).

The price Kyle paid after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount:
\[ P - 0.25P = 0.75P \]

We know that Kyle paid $19.50, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.

answer:  To find the average guess, we need to calculate each guess and then find the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend guesses 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend guesses 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

To find the average guess, we divide the total by the number of friends:
240 / 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans.

answer:  To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Raymond's Jewels:**
   Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Aaron's Jewels:**
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Aaron's jewels: \( 20 + 5 = 25 \)

3. **Siobhan's Jewels:**
   Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Siobhan's jewels: \( 25 - 2 = 23 \)

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

First, we determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 99 + 5 = B \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost $104.

answer:  To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the position of the first stop.
2. Determine the position of the second stop.
3. Calculate the distance between the two stops.

1. The first stop is after 20 miles.
2. The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, the second stop is at:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]
3. The distance between the first and second stops is:
   \[
   45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

answer:  To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's calculate 25% of the points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

Next, we add this to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes to find the points he scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is \( 9 \) points.

answer:  Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

answer:  To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he runs in a week.

First, let's calculate the total time John runs in a week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour.

answer:  To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week to get the weekly time.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.**

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Therefore, the total daily time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 2: Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week to get the weekly time.**

There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total weekly time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the number of hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs is \(\boxed{35}\).

answer:  If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
If she spends one-third of the time running, then she runs for (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours.
If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, then she walks for (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours.
The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.
Therefore, the total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, let's find out how much money John has left after buying the video games:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

John also has $5 left after buying the video games, so:
\[ \$35 + \$5 = \$40 \]

This means John has $40 left from selling his lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, we can find out how many lego sets he still has by dividing the remaining money by the price per lego set:
\[ \frac{\$40}{\$15} = \frac{8}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, John still has 2 lego sets.

answer:  Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.
The yogurt is on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so each yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.
Therefore, Terry spends 60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

answer:  First, let's determine the total calories in a 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many more calories you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, you can eat:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams/serving} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

answer:  To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.

Let's calculate the age of Ben's iPhone:
\[ \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone:
\[ \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

answer:  To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had in her purse from the total number used to find the number in the package she purchased.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used:
- She placed 1 Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.
- She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes used is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she had in her purse from the total number used to find the number in the package she purchased:
- She had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

answer:  To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the new distance.

1. Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw it for \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) feet.
3. The reach of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet. Subtracting this from the new distance: \(1200 - 1000 = 200\) feet.

Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon.

\boxed{200 feet}

answer:  First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought. He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the red ties.

\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, let's find the total amount spent on all ties.

\[ \text{Total amount spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent $800 on ties.

answer:  To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

1. **Total Revenue:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He sells 20 candles.
   - Total Revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

2. **Total Cost of Supplies:**
   - One pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00.
   - For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (since 1 pound makes 10 candles).
   - Total Cost = 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00

3. **Net Profit:**
   - Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Lloyd sells each dozen for $2:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294/\text{week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Additional articles: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \)
   - Total articles on Tuesday: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Articles on Wednesday: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \)

Now, we sum up the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

**Answer:** 104 hours

answer:  First, calculate the distance Tom travels while sailing. He sails at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM):

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, add the time spent sailing and the time spent traveling back to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time sailing} + \text{Time to travel back} = 3 \, \text{hours} + 5 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom a total of 8 hours to get back.

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

answer:  To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ units} = 90 \text{ occupied units} \]

Finally, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ occupied units} = 30 \text{ unoccupied units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

answer:  To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add the number of kittens adopted from the shelter to the number of kittens born by the house cats.

1. **Kittens adopted from the shelter:**
   - The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens.

2. **Kittens born by the house cats:**
   - Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ kittens}
     \]
   - Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total number of kittens:**
   - Add the number of kittens adopted from the shelter to the number of kittens born by the house cats:
     \[
     7 \text{ (adopted)} + 21 \text{ (Patchy's)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie's)} = 40 \text{ kittens}
     \]

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total.

answer:  First, determine how many lollipops Jean has left after eating 2:
\[ 30 \text{ lollipops} - 2 \text{ lollipops} = 28 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, calculate how many bags Jean can fill with 2 lollipops each:
\[ 28 \text{ lollipops} \div 2 \text{ lollipops per bag} = 14 \text{ bags} \]

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

answer:  First, calculate the total weight of the comic books:
\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/comic book} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:
\[ 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to reach the remaining 7.5 pounds, divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ 7.5 \text{ pounds} \div \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound/toy} = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

answer:  First, let's calculate the revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/tire = $480
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 (since no truck tires were repaired)
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between the two days:
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480
- Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on the day with higher revenue.

#### $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=40>>40

answer:  To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add the delivery fee, delivery fee, and tip to the original bill.

1. **Calculate the delivery fee:**
   - The delivery fee is 25% of the original bill.
   - Original bill = $40.00
   - Delivery fee = 25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

2. **Add the delivery fee to the original bill:**
   - Original bill = $40.00
   - Delivery fee = $10.00
   - Total after delivery fee = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

3. **Add the delivery fee and the tip:**
   - Delivery fee = $3.00
   - Tip = $4.00
   - Final price = $50.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is **$57.00**.

answer:  To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries.

First, calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters:
- There are 6 clusters.
- Each cluster contains 20 raspberries.

So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, add the number of individual raspberries:
- There are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

answer:  To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by that cost.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one movie outing is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie outing:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

answer:  To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Subtract this weight from the bridge's weight limit to find the remaining weight capacity.
3. Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
3. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
5. Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

answer:  To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension for the first 20 years and then the pension for the remaining 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Remaining 10 years:**
   - Marcy receives 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - Total pension for the remaining 10 years = ($50,000 * 0.05)/year * 10 years = $25,000.

3. **Total pension for 30 years:**
   - Total pension = $1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is $1,025,000.

answer:  For the first half of the year, Aleena pays $140 per month. There are 6 months in the first half of the year, so:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

For the second half of the year, Aleena is charged 10% less per month. First, calculate 10% of $140:

\[ 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \]

So, the charge per month for the second half of the year is:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

There are 6 months in the second half of the year, so:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

To find the total amount paid by the end of the year, add the amounts paid in both halves of the year:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, Aleena had paid $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

answer:  To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. The cost of the material: $500
2. The cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch: $800
3. The insurance fee: 10% of the total cost before insurance

First, let's calculate the total cost before insurance:
\[ \text{Total cost before insurance} = 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate the insurance fee:
\[ \text{Insurance fee} = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Finally, we add the insurance fee to the total cost before insurance to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, Janet paid $1430 for the brooch.

answer:  To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
\]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[
595
\]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of players and coaches sent per school:

1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Therefore, each school has a total of 2 teams * 5 players per team = 10 players.
4. Each school also has a coach for each team, so each school has 2 teams * 1 coach per team = 2 coaches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people sent by one school:

- Players per school: 10
- Coaches per school: 2
- Total people per school: 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all schools is:

- Total people sent by all schools: 12 people per school * 4 schools = 48 people

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

answer:  To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we need to add the number of instructions from both recipes.

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.
2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, it has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) instructions.

Now, we add the instructions from both recipes:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

answer:  First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session:

- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
- Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week:
- Jim does this 3 times a week.

So, in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.
\[ \boxed{36} \]

answer:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg):**
   - Sophia traveled 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas.
   - Miles per gallon (mpg) = Total miles / Total gallons = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg.

2. **Determine the total amount of gas in a full tank:**
   - The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

3. **Calculate the total miles she can drive on a full tank:**
   - Total miles = Miles per gallon * Total gallons = 25 mpg * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays, she teaches 5 classes per day for 5 days:
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
  \]
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes:
  \[
  8 \text{ classes}
  \]

Total classes in a week:
\[
25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
\]

Next, calculate the total number of students in a week:
\[
33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
\]

Finally, calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:
\[
495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.

answer:  To find the average square footage of a level, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

First, let's determine the square footage of each level:
- The top level has a square footage of 16.
- The second level has half the square footage of the top level, so it is \( 16 / 2 = 8 \).
- The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it is \( 8 / 2 = 4 \).
- The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it is \( 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now, let's calculate the total square footage:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

There are 4 levels in the sandcastle. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is \( 7.5 \) units.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

We are given that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounded to the nearest dollar is $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounded to the nearest dollar is $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounded to the nearest dollar is $2

Next, let's calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add up the total sales for all types of flowers:

Total sales = $36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias)
Total sales = $98

Therefore, Artie will make $98.

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount.
The discount is 30% of the original price of $100.
\[ \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the final cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes separately, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- Revenue from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $<<23*4=92>>92.

Now, we add the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
- Total amount raised = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
- Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221.

Therefore, Tommy raises $221.

answer:  To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.00.

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Difference = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

answer:  To find the total number of thorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose.

First, let's find the total number of roses:
- Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
- Each rose bush has 25 roses.

So, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of thorns:
- Each rose has 8 thorns.

So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 180 days:

\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the remaining 185 days:

\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required:

\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

answer:  To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight.

Given:
- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Let's calculate Alex's weight:

1. 4 times Grace's weight:
   \[
   4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds:
   \[
   500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we find their combined weights:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight}
\]
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 125 \text{ pounds} + 498 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 623 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, their combined weights are \boxed{623} pounds.

answer:  First, calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary:
- Initial monthly salary: $600
- Initial annual salary: $600 * 12 = $7200

Next, calculate the annual increase in salary:
- Annual increase: 10% of $7200 = 0.10 * $7200 = $720

Now, calculate Sylvie's salary after one year:
- Salary after one year: $7200 + $720 = $7920

Then, calculate Sylvie's salary after two years:
- Salary after two years: $7920 + $720 = $8640

Finally, calculate Sylvie's salary after three years:
- Salary after three years: $8640 + $720 = $9360

Now, calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three years:
- Annual salary after three years: $9360 * 12 = $112320

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $112320.

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's add the water received by the boy:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water consumed from the initial amount of water:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

answer:  To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each occurrence and then sum them up.

1. **First occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first occurrence lasted 4 rings, the second occurrence lasted \(3 \times 4 = 12\) rings.

3. **Third occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second occurrence lasted 12 rings, the third occurrence lasted \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) rings.

Now, we add up all the rings:
- First occurrence: 4 rings
- Second occurrence: 12 rings
- Third occurrence: 6 rings

Total rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

\[ 11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations} \]

Since each vacation corresponds to a quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is:
\[ 44 \text{ quilt blocks} \]

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
\[
\boxed{44}

answer:  Let's denote the number of games the football team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the football team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The remaining students are girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the Girl Scout.

Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

Finally, to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs:

- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs:

- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult dinosaur, so each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Now, let's add the total amount of potato salad needed for all the dinosaurs:

- Total potato salad needed = Total potato salad for adults + Total potato salad for children
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to have enough to feed all the adult and child dinosaurs.

answer:  Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald's record as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Calculate the division:

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

\[ \text{Total guests} = 16 \]

Next, determine how many guests don't show up:
\[ \text{Guests who don't show up} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

Now, calculate the number of guests who actually show up:
\[ \text{Guests who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, so the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ \text{Total gift bags} = 16 \times 0.75 = 12 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags.

answer:  To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits, then sum them up.

1. **Number of dogs:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Number of cats:**
   - There are two cats for every dog.
   - Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

3. **Number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.
   - Total number of pets = \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants after giving away some.

1. We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
   \[
   \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

2. We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is:
   \[
   \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

3. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

answer:  To determine how fast Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Gerald's original time:
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

2. Calculate Gerald's new time after the improved diet:
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.
   - 10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds.
   - Subtract this from his original time to get his new time:
   - Gerald's new time = 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining is:
\[ 30 - x \]

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining is:
\[ (30 - x) - 20 = 10 - x \]

Then, 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars remaining is:
\[ (10 - x) - 5 = 5 - x \]

We know that after these events, there are 0 cars left on the motorway. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5 - x = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 5 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]

answer:  To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover and then use the rate at which it covers that distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.

First, we find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \times 42 \text{ miles} \]

Simplify the calculation:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{10 \times 42}{3} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{420}{3} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

answer:  To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many hours James slept.
2. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

First, let's find out how many hours James slept. James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. Harry slept 9 hours, so:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{18}{3} \]

\[ \text{James's sleep} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed 20 times, the second friend pressed:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed 60 times, the third friend pressed:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]
4. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, we sum up all the rings:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

answer:  To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking.
2. Determine how many cans of tomatoes Freda used.
3. Calculate the total number of tomatoes used.

First, we know that when Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.

The volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. So, the original volume of the tomatoes is:
\[ 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the original volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can:
\[ \frac{64}{16} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used \(12\) tomatoes.

answer:  To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption into weekdays and weekends.

**Weekdays:**
- John drinks a glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks a glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks a glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks a glass of water before bed.

So, each weekday, John drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \]

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses/week} \]

**Weekends:**
- John does not drink any water on weekends.

So, each weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \]

There are 2 weekend days in a week, so:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses/week} \]

Therefore, John drinks:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses of water/week} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the remaining time watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Convert 1.5 hours to minutes:
\[ 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Each episode of the show is 30 minutes long. To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we divide the total time watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
\[ \frac{90}{30} = 3 \]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

answer:  First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[ \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

Next, let's find out how many pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Now, let's determine how many pieces her mom places. She places a third of the remaining pieces:

\[ \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

So, her mom places 250 pieces.

Finally, let's find out how many pieces are left to be placed:

\[ \text{Pieces left} = 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500 pieces.

answer:  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read and then divide that by the number of days he has left.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Next, we subtract the pages he has already read from the total:
- Pages read on Monday: 15 pages

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day.

answer:  First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of each box after accounting for the 1-inch thick walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
- Inner volume of one box = Length × Width × Height
- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
- Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
- Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3
- Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

answer:  First, we need to determine how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can set up a proportion to find the distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20 \times 64}{16} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet rowed, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

\boxed{16 liters}

answer:  Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to make \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

answer:  To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate.

Beatrice's roll-ups:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = Width * Length = 2 roll-ups * 24 roll-ups = 48 roll-ups

Marcell's roll-ups:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = Width * Length = 3 roll-ups * 14 roll-ups = 42 roll-ups

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 roll-ups + 42 roll-ups = 90 roll-ups

Finally, we calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten:
- Average = Total roll-ups / Number of people = 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups per person

So, the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45 roll-ups.

answer:  To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the number of teachers, the number of lessons each teacher has, and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

1. **Number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per teacher**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Cleanings per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons per day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleans per day:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleans per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleans per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback amount.
3. Subtract the cashback amount from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback:
- The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
- The customer buys 10 gallons.
- Total cost before cashback = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cashback amount:
- The app company offers $0.20 per gallon.
- The customer buys 10 gallons.
- Total cashback = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
- Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $10/board = $100

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $16/board = $80

Now, let's find the total cost of all the boards:
$100 + $80 = $180

The price of each board has increased by 50%, so the new price of each board is:
$10 * 1.50 = $15
$16 * 1.50 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards at the new prices:
10 boards * $15/board = $150
5 boards * $24/board = $120

Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = $270 - $180
Profit = $90

answer:  To determine how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the capacity of Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 50D = 300 \).
   - Solving for \( D \):
     \[
     D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\).

answer:  To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we first need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

The total number of parts in the ratio is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Since the total number of parts is 20, each part represents \(\frac{120}{20} = 6\) teaspoons.

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar she used is \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

answer:  To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day.
2. Determine the number of vehicles imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, let's calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day:
- There are 2 containers.
- Each container contains 5 vehicles.
- Total vehicles on the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

Next, we need to determine the number of vehicles imported on the second day:
- The total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30.
- Vehicles imported on the second day = 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles.

Finally, we calculate the number of containers imported on the second day:
- Each container contains 5 vehicles.
- Number of containers imported on the second day = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

answer:  Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can write:
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30000 \]

So, Lylah earned $30,000 four years ago.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Lylah's salary remains the same, which is $30,000.

Therefore, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 30000 = 86000 \]

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, we need to calculate the number of apples and oranges each person brought and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought:
- Morisette brought 5 apples.
- Morisette brought 8 oranges.

Total fruits brought by Morisette = 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.

Next, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Total fruits brought by Kael = 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits.

Now, we add the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael:
Total fruits = 13 fruits (Morisette) + 14 fruits (Kael) = 27 fruits.

Therefore, they have a total of 27 fruits together.

2. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month.

First, let's calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week:
- Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
- There are 30 sheets of paper in each pad.

So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month:
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \(5 + 1 = 6\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than Friday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours for each day:
\[ 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 36 \]

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 36 hours throughout the week.

answer:  To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

1. **Distance in the first 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Distance in the remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the next 4 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. **Total distance run in 7 hours:**
   - Total distance = Distance in the first 3 hours + Distance in the remaining 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

answer:  To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.
He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, the number of fish sausages is:
\[ 38 + 6 = 44 \]

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages:
\[ 38 + 44 = 82 \]

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

1. Julia bought a package with \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package with 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After setting the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

answer:  To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamps:**
   - Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps.
   - One-third of 60 is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of letters left unstamped:**
   - The total number of letters needing stamps is 60.
   - Jennie stamps 20 letters.
   - The number of letters left unstamped is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

3. **Determine the initial number of already-stamped letters:**
   - After Jennie stamps 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
   - Therefore, the initial number of already-stamped letters was \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was \( \boxed{10} \).

answer:  To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for each month and then sum them up.

In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500.

In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June was:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June to find the total:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940.

1. Calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them.
2. Subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial number of elves.
3. Subtract the number of elves that quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining elves.

1. Calculate the number of elves that quit after children vomit on them:
   \[
   \text{Number of elves that quit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. Subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial number of elves:
   \[
   \text{Number of elves remaining after children vomit} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

3. Subtract the number of elves that quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining elves:
   \[
   \text{Number of elves remaining after kids kick their shins} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30} \).

answer:  If each pepper costs $15, then each watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
Each orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.
Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
The total cost for the watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.
The total cost for the peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.
The total cost for the oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.
Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour, so the revenue from each patient is 0.4 * $200 = $80.
- The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total revenue from patients is 500 * $80 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the doctors:
- Each doctor charges $150 per hour, so the cost for each patient is 0.4 * $150 = $60.
- The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total cost for the doctors is 500 * $60 = $30,000.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes $10,000.

answer:  To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of car washes Tom gets in a year.
2. Calculate the total cost for those car washes in a year.

First, let's find out how many car washes Tom gets in a year:
- Tom gets 4 car washes per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of car washes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the car washes in a year:
- Each car wash costs $15.
- Tom gets 48 car washes in a year.

So, the total cost in a year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
- Total roller coaster tickets = 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.

Next, calculate the total number of tickets used for the luge rides:
- Pam rode the luge 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
- Fred rode the luge 2 times, so he used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
- Total luge tickets = 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.

Finally, add the total number of tickets used for both the roller coaster and the luge rides:
- Total roller coaster tickets = 36
- Total luge tickets = 24
- Total tickets used = 36 + 24 = 60 tickets.

So, Pam and Fred used a total of 60 tickets.

answer:  To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total distance Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total distance for Monday and Tuesday from the total distance for Monday through Wednesday to find the distance for Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday:
Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
\[ \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's find the total distance Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ \text{Total distance on Monday and Tuesday} = 4 + 24 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total distance for Monday and Tuesday from the total distance for Monday through Wednesday to find the distance for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

answer:  To determine the number of pink gumballs, we start by identifying the number of blue gumballs and the given relationship between the number of pink and blue gumballs.

Given:
- There are 12 blue gumballs.
- The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs can be expressed as:
\[ P = 4 \times \text{number of blue gumballs} + 22 \]

Substitute the number of blue gumballs into the equation:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Calculate the product of 4 and 12:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, add 22 to the result:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]

answer:  Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]
The first test had 75 questions, so he left:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Mark completed the second test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 6 hours to complete it:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]
The second test had 100 questions, so he left:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the questions left incomplete from both tests:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

Therefore, Mark left 105 questions incomplete altogether.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

answer:  Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each, so the cost of the subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.
She orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, so the cost of the chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
She orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so the cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.
There is a 20% delivery fee, so the delivery fee is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.
She wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the total cost of the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.
Therefore, the total cost of her delivery order is $29.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we need to calculate the tax amount. The tax rate is 10%, so:

Tax amount = $15 * 10% = $15 * 0.10 = $1.50

Finally, we add the tax amount to the total cost before tax to find the total cost including tax:

Total cost including tax = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

So, the total cost of everything, including tax, is $16.50.

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent 14 hours working instead. Since he earns $10 per hour:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

answer:  First, determine the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars} \]

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

answer:  Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).

There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, the number of queens is 100.

The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \).

The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

\boxed{400}

answer:  To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. Therefore, it has:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set. Therefore, it has:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Now, we add the number of pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces.

answer:  To determine the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. **First 6 hours**: Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: She sees half as many bees return as those that left in the first 6 hours. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. **Next 6 hours**: She sees two times as many bees fly from the hive as those that left in the first 6 hours. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees fly away.
4. **Next 6 hours**: Every bee that left before but hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means all 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours and the 15 bees that left in the next 6 hours return. So, \( 30 + 15 = 45 \) bees return.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 45.

answer:  To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples in John's field.
2. Determine how many harvests John can have in a year.
3. Multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in John's field:
- John has 10 hectares.
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
- Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples per hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Next, let's determine how many harvests John can have in a year:
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- Number of harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests.

Finally, multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests in a year:
- Total pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples * 4 har

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, let's calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 2 bottles of bleach = 2 * $2 = $4.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths = $5.
- Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9.
- For 8 clients, the total expenses = 8 clients * $9/client = $72.

Now, let's calculate the total income each week:
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72
- Profit = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

answer:  First, convert the distance each person needs to travel to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, find the difference in time between Steve and Tim:
- Difference in time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner (Steve) will be waiting 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of tires inflated:

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- Each unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Adding these together gives the total number of tires inflated:
10 tires + 9 tires + 1 tire = 20 tires.

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from inflating these tires. Each tire costs 25 cents, so:

20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day.

answer:  To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many friends Dorothy has.
2. Use the number of friends Dorothy has to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 12 \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James' friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the value of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{James' friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

answer:  To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 1 child ticket.
2. Calculate the cost of 1 adult ticket.
3. Add the cost of the child ticket and the adult ticket to find the total cost.
4. Add the change received to the total cost to find the total amount given.

Let's go through each step:

1. The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.
2. The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
3. The total cost for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the total amount she gave the cashier is:
   \[
   22 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount Brittany's mom gave the cashier is \boxed{30} dollars.

answer:  On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

In one week, Kimo spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/week} + 4 \text{ hours/week} = 7 \text{ hours/week} \]

In one semester, there are 16 weeks:
\[ 7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in one semester.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods:

Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Finally, let's convert the total length from inches to feet:

Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, all the baked goods will be 280 feet long.

answer:  To determine how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Determine the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies:
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies.
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's determine the total cost of the cookies:
Each cookie costs $0.10.
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays:
Carl pays with a $10 bill.
\[ 10 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]

answer:  To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $<<4*1.5=6>>6.

2. **Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $<<2*4=8>>8.

3. **Bond paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The rim costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6+8+20=34>>34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. The raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 14 - 7 - 9) = \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) = x - 20 \).
5. Ants ate 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind, so \( x - 20 - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x - 21 = 5 \]
\[ x = 5 + 21 \]
\[ x = 26 \]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 26.

1. Calculate the total number of bananas needed for one month:
   - Monkeys: 200 bananas
   - Gorillas: 400 bananas
   - Baboons: 100 bananas

   Total per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

2. Calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:
   - Total for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

- The price increases by 20% of the original price.
- The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
- 20% of $20 is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.

So, the price increase every two months is $4.

Next, we need to determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
- 36 months is equivalent to \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) two-month periods.

Now, we calculate the total price increase over 36 months:
- Total price increase = \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total price increase to the original price:
- New price = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, a bag of marbles after 36 months would cost $92.

answer:  Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. Therefore, he runs:
\[ 15 \times 100 = 1500 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

She does this 34 times, so she runs:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the 100 yards she runs back and forth once, her total distance is:
\[ 100 + 2720 = 2820 \text{ yards} \]

The difference in distance between Kelly and Blake is:
\[ 2820 - 1500 = 1320 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Kelly) runs 1320 yards farther than Blake.

answer:  To determine the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the red cars:**
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Total cost for red cars: \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the action figures:**
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Total cost for action figures: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of the doll: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost of all toys:**
   - Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
   - Total cost = \( 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is 50 dollars.

answer:  To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the depth of the water on Monday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the depth on Monday.
3. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday by taking two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

\boxed{16}

answer:  Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
- Total fish caught by Anakin: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19
- Total fish caught by Locsin: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13

Finally, let's add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

answer:  To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she gets each time:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs per babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitings} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

answer:  To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. Spiders:
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders = 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

2. Insects:
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects = 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

3. Rare mutant invertebrates:
   - Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (rare mutants) = 1210 legs

answer:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the income lost from doing the taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income lost from doing the taxes herself:
- Jackie misses 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour.
- Total income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $<<3*35=105>>105.

Next, let's consider the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, let's calculate the net gain in money if Jackie hires the accountant:
- Net gain = Income lost from doing the taxes herself - Cost of hiring the accountant
- Net gain = $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15.

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more than if she does the taxes herself.

answer:  To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   - The hat costs $25.

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jacket is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   - The average cost of the hat and the jacket is \( \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   - Add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.
   - Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
   - Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is \( \boxed{150} \).

1. Calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories.
2. Subtract the total cost from her budget.

First, let's add up the total cost of the computer and its accessories:
- Cost of the computer: €1090
- Cost of the scanner: €157
- Cost of the CD burner: €74
- Cost of the printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Next, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Budget: €1500
- Total cost: €1423

Money left = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

   - Pancho walks 20 miles a day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles on weekdays = 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles a day.
   - There are 2 weekends in a week.
   - Total miles on weekends = 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:

Total miles in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekends) = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50 \text{ per glass} = \$10 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade, which includes the cost of lemons and sugar:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Since they made $25 in profit, the total revenue must be:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Profit} = \$5 + \$25 = \$30 \]

Now, calculate the total number of gallons they made:
\[ \text{Total gallons} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Revenue per gallon}} = \frac{\$30}{10} = 3 \]

Finally, calculate the total cost of lemons:
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 3 \times \$3 = \$9 \]

answer:  First, calculate the total time to peel all the potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- There are 60 potatoes.
- Total time to peel = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes.

Next, calculate the total time to cut all the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- There are 60 potatoes.
- Total time to cut = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds.

Convert the total cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- 300 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 5 minutes.

Now, add the total time to peel and the total time to cut to find the total preparation time:
- Total time to peel = 90 minutes
- Total time to cut = 5 minutes
- Total preparation time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

answer:  First, let's determine the age of each bird based on the given information:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd tutored 5 hours in the first week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his earnings for the first week are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the second week:
- Lloyd tutored 8 hours in the second week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his earnings for the second week are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's sum his earnings for both weeks:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

answer:  First, calculate Jessica's monthly payment for each debt by paying 50% more than the minimum:

- Student loans: $300/month + 50% of $300/month = $300/month + $150/month = $450/month
- Credit card: $200/month + 50% of $200/month = $200/month + $100/month = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500/month + 50% of $500/month = $500/month + $250/month = $750/month

Next, add up the monthly payments for all debts to find the total monthly payment:

$450/month + $300/month + $750/month = $1500/month

Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by the number of months in a year to find the total annual payment:

$1500/month * 12 months/year = $18000/year

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year.

answer:  To find the total number of crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of crabs each person has:
\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs}
\]
\[
\text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

Therefore, the total number of crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is 122.

answer:  To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Chinese people.
2. Subtract the number of boys on the Chinese team from the total number of Chinese people to find the number of girls.

First, let's find the total number of Chinese people:
- There are 240 Asians in total.
- 80 of these Asians are Japanese.

So, the number of Chinese people is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Thus, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team.

answer:  Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.
The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500.
He donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.
After donating to the charity, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.
He gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses, so he has $1250 - $200 = $1050 left.
He gives his wife $700 for groceries and household goods, so he has $1050 - $700 = $350 left.
Therefore, Zaid will still have $350 after all these expenses and donations.

answer:  To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race and then find the difference between these times.

**Team A:**
- Each runner runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 runners.
- Total time for Team A = 55 seconds * 4 runners = 220 seconds.

**Team B:**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs their leg in 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs their leg in 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs their leg in 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds.
- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

**Difference in time:**
- Difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team (Team A) wins by 2 seconds.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jan's current age:**
   - Jan is currently 30 years old.

2. **Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years old.

3. **Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 20 years old two years ago, his current age is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) years old.

4. **Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jean is 24 years old.

answer:  To determine the number of votes the loser received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes the winner received.
2. Subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

1. Calculate the number of votes the winner received:
   \[
   \text{Number of votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of votes for the winner} = \frac{3 \times 80}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
   \]

2. Subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes:
   \[
   \text{Number of votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Number of votes for the winner}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

answer:  To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the total interest over the 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

First, calculate the monthly interest:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest over 3 months:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Monthly Interest} \times \text{Number of Months} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 2 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 6 \]

Finally, add the total interest to the principal amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

answer:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.
2. Determine the number of red roses Sandra ordered based on the number of white carnations.

First, we know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{\text{Number of pink calla lilies}}{5} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{Number of white carnations} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the hamsters and rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces
- Rabbits: 20 pieces

Total straw for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces

Next, we know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among all rodents is 160. Therefore, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:

160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find the total number of rats, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:

90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:

15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each of the three cages.

answer:  First, calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
- The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
- There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

Next, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die:
- The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.
- There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
- Probability = 3/6 * 3/6 = 9/36 = 1/4 = 25%.

Now, compare the two probabilities:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 50%
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 25%

The difference in probability is:
- 50% - 25% = 25%

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

1. Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
2. Calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna.
3. Add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to get the total.

Given:
- Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
- Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

First, calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} + \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

answer:  To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement.

First, let's find the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, for ten ducks:

\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly requirement by 7:

\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

answer:  Let's denote the number of bags of wheat sold as \( x \).

The total cost for the trader to buy and transport \( x \) bags of wheat is:
\[ 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The total revenue from selling \( x \) bags of wheat is:
\[ 30x \]

The profit made by the trader is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. According to the problem, the profit is $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

answer:  To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. The cost of one pen is the sum of the cost of a pencil and an eraser.

Given:
- Cost of a pencil = $1.20
- Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of one pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the food:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183.00 \]

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total amount spent by the number of friends:
\[ \text{Amount each friend paid} = \frac{183.00}{3} = 61.00 \]

Therefore, each friend paid $61.00.

answer:  To determine how much change Violetta will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons:
- Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
- Each crayon costs $2.

Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 crayons × $2 per crayon
Total cost = $10

Next, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:
- Violetta has $20.

Change = Amount of money - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 in change.

answer:  First, determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher:
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- He edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, so he edits \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences for each publisher.

Next, calculate the pay per sentence for each publisher:
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.

Now, calculate the total earnings from each publisher:
- Earnings from Publisher A: \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents
- Earnings from Publisher B: \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents

Finally, add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:
- Total earnings: \( 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \) cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

\[ \boxed{7500} \]

answer:  To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years.
2. Determine the number of trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees remaining after the trees die.

First, let's calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years:

- Tom starts with 50 trees.
- He plants 10 trees per year for 10 years: \(10 \times 10 = 100\) trees.
- He chops down 2 trees per year for 10 years: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has:
\[ 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 \]

Next, 30% of the trees die:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \]

The number of trees remaining is:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \]

answer:  Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

To find the total number of cards she has now, we add up all the cards she has collected:
\[ 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \]

Therefore, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards now.

answer:  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the pinkos and painted them white:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]
So, 6 pink plastic flamingos were taken back and painted white.

The number of pink plastic flamingos left is:
\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos:
\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]

At noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink plastic flamingos and 6 white plastic flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

answer:  To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of grapes produced on the farm per year.
2. Convert the total amount of grapes into barrels of wine.

First, let's calculate the total amount of grapes produced on the farm per year:
- Josie has 10 acres of land.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.

So, the total amount of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to convert the total amount of grapes into barrels of wine:
- Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

\[ \boxed{100} \]

answer:  Let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used during the week.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices.

2. **Cheese and egg omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days.
   - Each omelet uses one more slice than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices.
   - Total slices for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish of macaroni and cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices:
- Total slices = 14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

Therefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese.

answer:  To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water per pail.

First, let's find the total number of pails Baldur gets in a day:
- He gets 5 pails in the morning.
- He gets 6 pails in the afternoon.

So, the total number of pails in a day is:
\[ 5 \text{ pails} + 6 \text{ pails} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water in a day is:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of the bag} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the 5% raise in John's salary. John's original salary is $2000 per week. A 5% raise is:

\[ 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, John's new weekly salary after the raise is:

\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

Now, let's calculate John's new annual salary after the raise:

\[ 2100 \times 52 = 111200 \]

Finally, let's add the one-time monetary reward to John's annual salary. The one-time reward is $5000.

So, John's total earnings for the year are:

\[ 111200 + 5000 = 116200 \]

Therefore, John made a total of $116200 that year.

answer:  Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \).
Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

The total number of eggs collected every day is given as 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

First, expand and simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Next, solve for \( r \):

\[ 8r = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ r = 4 \]

answer:  Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.

First, let's calculate the total number of pens she bought:
- She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens.
  \[
  6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens}
  \]
- She bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens.
  \[
  2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens}
  \]

Now, let's add the total number of blue and red pens:
\[
54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 66 \text{ pens}
\]

Finally, let's add the initial number of green and yellow pens:
\[
22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 66 \text{ pens} = 98 \text{ pens}
\]

answer:  Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn an additional:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so we set up the equation:
\[ 20 + 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 60 - 20 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

answer:  To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests.
2. Determine the total score Brinley currently has from the first five tests.
3. Subtract the current total score from the required total score to find the score needed on the sixth test.

First, calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Next, calculate the total score Brinley currently has from the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Finally, subtract the current total score from the required total score to find the score needed on the sixth test:
\[ 558 - 438 = 120 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

answer:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

So, the amount of water left in the small pool now is \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water left in the big pool now is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -x = -48 \]

So, the small pool has 48 gallons of water now.

answer:  To find the total cost of buying each cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Calculate the cost of each cup.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Each plate costs $6000.
- Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
- Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:
- Twenty dozen cups is 24 cups.
- Cost of each cup = $34800 / 24 cups = $1450.

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $1450.

answer:  To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide that by his walking speed.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 1.5 miles
- Width = 6 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( T \) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]
\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking.

answer:  First, let's determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored \( 54 \) points.

answer:  First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

1. Harriet's current age: 21 years
2. Adrian's current age: 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years
3. Zack's current age: 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
2. Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years
3. Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years

Now, we calculate the average age in three years:

Average age in three years = (Harriet's age in three years + Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years) / 3
Average age in three years = (24 + 66 + 45) / 3
Average age in three years = 135 / 3 = 45 years

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return an additional 10% of the amount.

\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + (0.10 \times 2000) \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month.

\[ \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Total payment} = 1980 \]

Now, let's find the remaining balance after 12 months.

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total payment} \]

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $220.

answer:  To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
2. Determine the total number of customers over the first two days.
3. Subtract the total number of customers over the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, let's calculate the number of customers on the second day:
- Sloane counts 100 customers on the first day.
- On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day.
- Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.

Next, let's determine the total number of customers over the first two days:
- Total customers over the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250.

Finally, let's find the number of customers on the third day:
- Number of customers on the third day = 500 - 250 = 250.

answer:  To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in each year and then sum them up.

1. The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.
2. The company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year on advertising for the second year.

First, calculate the amount spent in the second year:
\[ \text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 \]
\[ \text{Amount spent in the second year} = 5000 \]

Next, add the amounts spent in both years to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Amount spent in the first year} + \text{Amount spent in the second year} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

answer:  To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias and then add it to the number of geraniums.

Given:
- Andy plants 90 geraniums.
- He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

First, calculate the number of petunias:
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 50 \]

Next, add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 140 \]

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.

answer:  To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and the number of dahlias.

Number of roses: 4
Number of dahlias: 7 more than the number of roses, so 4 + 7 = 11

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total.

answer:  To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- Therefore, the time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- Therefore, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on sudoku puzzles: 40 minutes
- Therefore, the total time spent playing these games is \( 30 + 40 = 70 \) minutes.

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of Chad's order:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

So, the total cost of Chad's order is $14.00.

Next, Chad uses a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract this amount from the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00 after using the gift card.

The final answer is $9.00.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cards James has initially:
- Fire type cards: 30
- Grass type cards: 20
- Water type cards: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, let's account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
- He buys 14 grass type cards, so he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
Total new cards = 32 (water) + 34 (grass) + 30 (fire) = 96

Finally, let's calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage of water type cards = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
Percentage of water type cards = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer:

answer:  To determine how many liters of water are in the tank now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of water in the tank.
2. Subtract the amount of water Celine used to water her garden.
3. Add the amount of rainwater she collected.

Let's go through the steps:

1. The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water to water her garden. So, the amount of water left is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Adding the rainwater to the remaining water gives:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is 90 liters.

answer:  To determine the total cost for Carlos and Benji's rental, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then sum the amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Total cost for Carlos = $30/hour * 3 hours = $90.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Total cost for Benji = $18/hour * 5 hours = $90.

Now, we add the costs for both Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:
- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180.

Therefore, they will pay $180 for their rentals altogether.

Finally, add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration cost to find the total amount paid:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, Mark pays $276,000 for everything.

answer:  To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices required.
2. Determine how many pizzas are needed given that each pizza has 8 slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices required:
- There are 20 friends.
- Each friend will have 4 slices.

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required:
- Each pizza has 8 slices.

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

answer:  To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and the time it takes to return by car.

1. **Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Therefore, it takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days to travel by car.

Now, let's calculate the total travel time:
- Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus: 6 days
- Travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car: 3 days

Total travel time = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 60 by 60:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

#### 1 hour.

answer:  To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he eats by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

Next, determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Now, calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

Finally, determine the number of students who went out through exit C:
\[ \text{Number of students through exit C} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students through exit A} - \text{Students through exit B} \]
\[ \text{Number of students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(280\).

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

Next, calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after two months.

Then, calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest two weeks later:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.

Finally, calculate the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

answer:  To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of ants and the number of bugs.

Given:
- Number of ants = 50
- Number of bugs = half the number of ants

First, calculate the number of bugs:
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{\text{Number of ants}}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, add the number of ants and the number of bugs to find the total number of insects:
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

answer:  To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we need to determine each of their ages first.

1. Jessa is 20 years old.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Now, we add the ages of the three girls:
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age}
\]
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = 23 + 25 + 20
\]
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = 68
\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly phone plan to find out how many minutes he has left:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left.

answer:  To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to subtract the number of penguins that swim in the ocean and go inside the cave from the total number of penguins.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that swim in the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins swim in the ocean.

2. Calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

3. Calculate the total number of penguins that are not sunbathing:
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]

4. Subtract the number of penguins that are not sunbathing from the total number of penguins:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \boxed{12}.

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider both the pens he initially buys and the new pens he can make from the ink in his empty pens.

1. **Initial Pens:**
   - Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Making New Pens:**
   - For every 5 empty pens, Ram can make one new pen.
   - Therefore, if Ram has 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.

3. **Total Pens:**
   - Adding the initial 25 pens to the 5 new pens, Ram will have a total of \( 25 + 5 = 30 \) pens.

Thus, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.

answer:  First, let's determine how many people Mike is currently writing to. He used to be a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped with 2 of them, so he is now writing to 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike writes each week. Each person sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long, so each person sends 2 letters * 5 pages/letter = 10 pages per week. Since Mike is writing to 3 people, he writes a total of 10 pages/person * 3 people = 30 pages per week.

Now, let's determine how many minutes Mike spends writing each week. He writes 1 page every 6 minutes, so for 30 pages, he spends 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes per week.

Finally, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours per week.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has 54 candies and has twice as many candies as Robert. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Let's denote the number of candies James has as \( J \).

\[ J = R + 6 \]

Substituting the value of \( R \):

\[ J = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies.

Finally, we need to determine how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies.

\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

answer:  To determine how many apps are on Travis's tablet now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of apps on his tablet.
2. Subtract the number of apps he deleted.
3. Add the number of apps he downloaded.

Let's start with the initial number of apps:
\[ 61 \]

Next, we subtract the number of apps he deleted:
\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

Then, we add the number of apps he downloaded:
\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

Therefore, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet.

answer:  To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the number of books each person has and how they will read each other's books.

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. They will read each other's books in addition to their own.

Let's break it down:

- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book.
- Therefore, Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora also reads Dolly's 2 books.
- Therefore, Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we add the number of books each person reads:

- Total books read by Dolly: 3
- Total books read by Pandora: 3

Total books read by both:
- 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 6 books by the end.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the makeup before the discount:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
3. Jean needs it done 4 times a week.
4. The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Next, let's calculate the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total:

Final cost = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin then had \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(G\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After Ginger gave \(G\) fries, Griffin had \(9 + G\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin then had \((9 + G) - 2 = 7 + G\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, \(7 + G = 27\).
7. Solving for \(G\), we get \(G = 27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cows initially in the stalls:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each of the 20 stalls, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows per stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, there are 16 cows in 8 of the stalls.

answer:  Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 28 = 2f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

\[ 50 \text{ pounds/bag} \times 4 \text{ bags} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the onions. The cost per pound is $1.50:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent $300.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the total number of boys and girls in the school is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

The number of boys in the third class is the total number of students in the third class minus the number of girls:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Therefore, there are 17 boys in the third class.

\[ 52 - 8 = 44 \text{ apples} \]

Next, let's find out how many bananas Jamal has. We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Therefore, Jamal has:

\[ 44 + 4 = 48 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's determine how many bananas Andrea has. We know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Therefore, Andrea has:

\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Finally, let's add up the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cookies Sue ate on each day:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, let's calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed:

- Total cookies Sue ate: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies
- Calories Sue consumed: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories her sister consumed:

- Total cookies her sister ate: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies
- Calories her sister consumed: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed each night and then sum them up.

**Last Night:**
- Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Rick killed 15 cougars.

**Total Animals Last Night:**
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

**Today:**
- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Rick killed three fewer cougars than last night.

First, calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ wolves} \]

Next, calculate the number of cougars killed today:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

**Total Animals Today:**
\[ 45 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 57 \text{ animals} \]

**Total Animals:**
\[ 25 + 57 = 82 \text{ animals} \]

answer:  To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Determine how many times Robert went down the water slide based on Anne's performance.

First, let's calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, and Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - (0.30 \times 30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 21 \]

Next, let's determine how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is \( \boxed{84} \).

answer:  To determine how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard.
2. Calculate the number of trees in Harry's yard.
3. Find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.

First, let's find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard:
- Chris has 6 trees.
- Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
- Therefore, Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.

Next, let's find the number of trees in Harry's yard:
- Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
- Therefore, Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard:
- The difference is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \) trees.

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard.

answer:  To find out how much Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Pennies:
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Value of pennies = 100 pennies * $0.01 per penny = $1.00

2. Nickels:
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Value of nickels = 40 nickels * $0.05 per nickel = $2.00

3. Dimes:
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Value of dimes = 20 dimes * $0.10 per dime = $2.00

4. Dollar bills:
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - Value of dollar bills = 40 dollar bills * $1.00 per dollar bill = $40.00

Total value = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes = 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes

So, the time to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:
20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes

Next, calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it does to warm up the oil.

Cooking time = 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Finally, add up all the times to find the total time from starting the oil to having the cooked chicken.

Total time = Heating time to 300 degrees + Heating time to 400 degrees + Cooking time
Total time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes
Total time = 71 minutes

#### 71 minutes.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total weight of the 200-foot redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the 200-foot tree is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \times 400 \text{ pounds/foot} = 80000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

30% of 80000 pounds is:
\[ 0.30 \times 80000 \text{ pounds} = 24000 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the remaining weight of the tree after the termites ate some of it is:
\[ 80000 \text{ pounds} - 24000 \text{ pounds} = 56000 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood tree is 56000 pounds.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \times 36}{12} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's determine how many cups of flour are needed for 30 cookies. Using the same proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{2 \times 30}{12} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Together, Carla will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

answer:  To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for each house is:
  \[
  3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
  \]

Next, let's add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in each house is:
  \[
  6 \text{ windows} + 4 \text{ windows} = 10 \text{ windows}
  \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is:
\[
10 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20 windows.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, add the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 \]

Finally, subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \$25 = \$100 + \$25 = \$125
   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = \text{Samantha's money} + \$50 = \$125 + \$50 = \$175
   \]

Now, we add up the amounts of money all three girls have:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = \$100 + \$125 + \$175 = \$400
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400.

The final answer is:

answer:  To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup.
2. Convert the number of pennies into dollars.

First, let's find two thirds of 9,300 pennies:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.

Next, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is $62.

answer:  To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
   So, the second bag has 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   So, the third bag has 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:
\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762
\]

Therefore, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part:

1. **Solo Song:**
   - Sean's solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines.

answer:  To determine the total amount the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Each newspaper ad costs $5.
- Total cost for newspaper ads = 50 ads * $5/ad = $<<50*5=250>>250.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent bought 15 television ads.
- Each television ad costs $75.
- Total cost for television ads = 15 ads * $75/ad = $<<15*75=1125>>1125.

Now, we add the total cost of the newspaper ads and the total cost of the television ads:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375.

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1375 on all the ads.

answer:  First, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, calculate the total price of the house:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Finally, determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
Difference = Total price - Budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Now, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
- Total cost = $800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200.

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

answer:  Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side of the equation:
   \[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

2. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

3. Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[ 3S = 18 \]

4. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

answer:  To determine the change the cashier gives back, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
Amount paid = $20.00
Total cost = $15.00

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $15.00
Change = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

\[ M + M = 20 \]

We need to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( M + 10 \). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (M + 10) = M + M + 20 \]

Since we know \( M + M = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

answer:  To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length of the sterling silver beads by the length of one sterling silver bead to find the number of beads.

First, calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, divide the length of the sterling silver beads by the length of one sterling silver bead:
\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div 0.5 \text{ inches/bead} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

answer:  The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.
Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.
Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \).
- There are 3 coaches.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195.

answer:  To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
\[ \text{Cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
\[ \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of popsicles} + \text{Cost of ice cream bars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.

answer:  To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

1. **Time for small holes:**
   - It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - For 30 small holes: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes.

2. **Time for large holes:**
   - It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
   - For 15 large holes: \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes.

3. **Total time in minutes:**
   - Total time = \( 90 + 150 = 240 \) minutes.

4. **Convert total time to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \( \frac{240}{60} = 4 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

answer:  To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the known rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the known rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtracting the stars in the known rows from the total number of stars gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives us the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]
\[ \text{Total number of spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

1. **Alani:**
   - First week: 20 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 20 = 40 stories
   - Total for Alani: 20 + 40 = 60 stories

2. **Braylen:**
   - First week: 40 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 40 = 80 stories
   - Total for Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120 stories

3. **Margot:**
   - First week: 60 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 60 = 120 stories
   - Total for Margot: 60 + 120 = 180 stories

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars consumed by the adults. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars consumed by the adults from the total number of chocolate bars:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children. There are 8 children:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( M \).

Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

According to the problem, together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means they have \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the total medals given out.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 39 = \frac{1}{10}M \]

To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:
\[ M = 39 \times 10 \]
\[ M = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

answer:  To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the first day:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 activities

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses: 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the second day:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 activities

Total activities over the two days:
170 activities (first day) + 200 activities (second day) = 370 activities

Therefore, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is 370.

answer:  To determine how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges washed by the oldest son.
2. Calculate the number of oranges washed by the youngest son.
3. Find the total number of oranges washed by both sons.
4. Subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges.

1. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
2. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he washes \( 8 / 2 = 4 \) oranges.
3. The total number of oranges washed by both sons is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) oranges.
4. The initial number of oranges is 15, so the number of oranges left unwashed is \( 15 - 12 = 3 \) oranges.

Therefore, 3 oranges are left unwashed.

answer:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and covered 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 30 miles/hour. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same 480 miles, we use the same formula:

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same 480 miles.

answer:  Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
She pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes.
So, she works for a total of 3 hours - 30 minutes = 2.7 hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.7 hours is equal to 2.7 * 60 = 162 minutes.
Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so in 162 minutes, she earns 162 / 10 = 16.20.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a day:
- Distance to work: 30 miles
- Distance back home: 30 miles
- Total distance per day: 30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles

Next, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year:
- Number of days per week: 5
- Number of weeks per year: 50
- Total distance per year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year

Finally, let's add the monthly bonus:
- Monthly bonus: $150
- Total annual cost: $30000/year + ($150/month * 12 months/year) = $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year

answer:  To determine how much money the desk costs Carmen, we need to follow the sequence of bids.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. The first person bids once, increasing the price to $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The second person bids once, increasing the price to $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The third person bids once, increasing the price to $300 + $50 = $350.
5. Carmen then bids once, increasing the price to $350 + $50 = $400.

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $400.

answer:  First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is under 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after distributing the extra points:

- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Adding these together:

22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the total earnings from the second year.

First, we know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we know that the total number of books sold over three years is 250. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 250 - 90 - 45 = 115 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total earnings from the second year are:
\[ 115 \times 20 = 2300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed 2300 \]

answer:  To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household per day.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal, and there are 5 members in the household. Therefore, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 5 \text{ members} = 1 \text{ kg/day} \]

Since there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner), the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/day} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bag by the weekly consumption:
\[ 42 \text{ kg} \div 14 \text{ kg/week} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last \boxed{3} weeks.

answer:  Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount left is:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annika has $15 left.

answer:  First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy loses in one week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy loses:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks). If Sandy loses 0.5 pounds per week, the number of weeks required to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

answer:  To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- On Tuesday: 15 crates
- On Wednesday: 12 crates
- On Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18

Now, let's perform the addition:
20 + 15 = 35
35 + 12 = 47
47 + 18 = 65

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

Next, we compare the total crates sold to the target of 120 crates:
Target = 120 crates
Total crates sold = 65 crates

Difference = Target - Total crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55 crates

Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

1. Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.
2. Determine the total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, which is twice the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

First, let's calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:
- On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
- On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.

Total time on Monday and Sunday = 16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes.

Next, we need to find the total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, which is twice the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:
Total time on Tuesday = 2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

answer:  First, calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

Next, determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
\[ \text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Then, calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day by the three people who eat three eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day by the remaining two people who eat two eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, let's add the eggs consumed per day by both groups:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Finally, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

answer:  First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings:
- He works 10 hours each day.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- He works 5 days a week.

Weekly earnings = 10 hours/day * $10/hour * 5 days/week = $500/week.

Next, let's calculate his monthly earnings for April:
- April has approximately 4 weeks.

Monthly earnings = $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000.

Now, let's add the $300 bonus each week:
- Monthly bonus = $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200.

Finally, let's calculate his total earnings for April:
- Total earnings = Monthly earnings + Monthly bonus
- Total earnings = $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

6 business suits * $100 per suit = $6000

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 per suitcase = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1250

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
$6000 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1250 (flight ticket) = $7400

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has:
$7400 - $2000 = $5400

Therefore, Theo has $5400 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

answer:  To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the tabloid. In a simple folding newspaper, each page is printed on both sides of a piece of paper.

For a 32-page tabloid:
- Page 1 is printed on the left back.
- Page 2 is printed on the left front.
- Page 3 is printed on the left back.
- Page 4 is printed on the left front.
- Page 5 is printed on the left back.
- Page 6 is printed on the left front.
- ...
- Page 31 is printed on the left back.
- Page 32 is printed on the left front.

Since each page is printed on both sides of a piece of paper, the total number of pieces of paper used is half the number of pages.

For a 32-page tabloid:
\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) people
- She invited 3 families with 4 people each: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) people

Total invited people: \( 12 + 12 = 24 \) people

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of that number had previous commitments: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people

Total people who couldn't come: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of invited people to find out how many people showed up:

Total invited people: 24
People who couldn't come: 10
People who showed up: \( 24 - 10 = 14 \)

Therefore, 14 people showed up for Martha's party.

answer:  Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Given that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \]

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

First, calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people.

Next, subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled to find out how many people he lost to:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Discount per tub: $13 - $11 = $2

Next, let's calculate the total discount for two tubs of ice cream:

- Total discount for milk: $0.5/packet * 4 packets = $2

Finally, let's find the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:
- Total discount for ice cream: $4
- Total discount for milk: $2
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, you will save $6 in total.

answer:  To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children, and then sum them up.

1. **Number of boys:**
   The classroom has 30 boys.

2. **Number of girls:**
   The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of nongendered children:**
   The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total number of children:**
   Add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the classroom has a total of \(123\) children.

answer:  Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can denote the number of electric poles as \( P \) and the number of electric wires as \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:

\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45:

\[ W = 45 \]

Using the ratio, we can express \( P \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ P = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the equation:

\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45 \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

answer:  To determine the number of new limbs grown after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of new arms:
- The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of new arms grown is:
  \[
  \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of new legs:
- The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of new legs grown is:
  \[
  \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
  \]

Now, we add the number of new arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs:
\[
5 \text{ arms} + 3 \text{ legs} = 8 \text{ limbs}
\]

Therefore, after 15 days, a person will grow 8 new limbs.

answer:  Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \).

So, we have:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, each box contains 8 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Thus, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

answer:  Currently, Cera is 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

The population of Chile was half of what it is now, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120,000.

answer:  Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store now is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

His father then gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, the total number of marbles after receiving from his father is:

\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Cooling effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - Therefore, the number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \).

2. **Weakening effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters.

3. **Weakening effect of added cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total weakening effect:**
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the cream.
   - Total weakening effect = \( 60 + 15 = 75 \) milliliters.

answer:  Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ x + 5 \]

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   So, he buys 28 more lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, after all these transactions, Oscar has:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the party initially:

\[ \text{Total people} = 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left:

\[ \text{People who left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who stayed is:

\[ \text{People who stayed} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of women who stayed is:

\[ \text{Women who stayed} = 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ women} \]

The number of women who left is:

\[ \text{Women who left} = 15 - 8 = 7 \text{ women} \]

Thus, 7 women are left.

answer:  To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned by the customer.
2. Determine the discount provided by the coupon.
3. Subtract the total discount from the original purchase.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned by the customer.**

The customer spent $43 this shopping trip. The rewards are $1 off for every $20 spent.

\[ \text{Rewards} = \left\lfloor \frac{43}{20} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

**Step 2: Determine the discount provided by the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total discount from the original purchase.**

The total discount is the sum of the rewards and the coupon discount.

\[ \text{Total discount} = 2 + 4 = 6 \]

So, the customer paid \( 43 - 6 = 37 \) on this shopping trip.

answer:  Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as \( x \).

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the number of new records each person receives is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

If there are 5 people, the total number of new records they receive is \( 5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \).

We know that the total number of new records they receive is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 5x = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 2.8 \]

So, each person brought in 2.8 old records. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records they brought in is:

\[ 5 \times 2.8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records in total.

answer:  The total number of employees is 100.
The number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.
The number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.
Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total payment for junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.
Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
The total payment for senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.
The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

answer:  To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for both the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- He wants to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar for the suckers is: \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, let's calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
- He wants to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar for the fudge is: \( 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
\[ 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

 Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar.

answer:  To find out how many guns each person would have if they share them equally, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guns.
2. Determine the number of people sharing the guns.
3. Divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each person would get.

First, let's calculate the total number of guns:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.

Next, let's determine the number of people sharing the guns:
- There are 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ).

Now, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each person would get:
- Total number of guns = 24
- Number of people = 4

Each person would get 24 guns / 4 people = 6 guns.

So, each person would have 6 guns.

answer:  To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone, we need to calculate the total time required to increase the charge from 60% to 100%.

1. **Calculate the total percentage increase needed:**
   - Current charge: 60%
   - Final charge: 100%
   - Percentage increase: 100% - 60% = 40%

2. **Determine the rate of charging:**
   - The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time required:**
   - Total percentage increase: 40%
   - Time per 1 percentage-point: 3 minutes
   - Total time: 40% * 3 minutes/% = 120 minutes

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \). According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

And the total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs for all the animals:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the animals have a total of 160 legs all together.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

1. Advance payment: $1,350
2. Monthly installments: 6 installments * $350 per installment = $2,100

Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:

1. Advance payment: $1,100
2. Monthly installments: 9 installments * $250 per installment = $2,250

Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:

Total cost for Furniture United: $3,450
Total cost for Cozy Homes: $3,350

Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has \( x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \) students.

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

answer:  First, we need to determine the new distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters.

To find the additional distance:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new distance Tyson should run each day is:
\[ \text{New distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June. June has 30 days.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{New distance} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up all the outfits she has received:

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Since she received 24 outfits from her friend, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) outfits at the baby shower.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[ 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 \]

Therefore, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby.

answer:  First, calculate the initial value of Maria's shares:
- 8 shares * $8 per share = $<<8*8=64>>64

Next, calculate the new stock price after the first year's increase:
- Initial stock price: $8
- Increase: 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $<<0.50*8=4>>4
- New stock price: $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12

Then, calculate the new stock price after the second year's decrease:
- New stock price: $12
- Decrease: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $<<0.25*12=3>>3
- Final stock price: $12 - $3 = $<<12-3=9>>9

Finally, calculate the final value of all Maria's shares:
- 8 shares * $9 per share = $<<8*9=72>>72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

The answer is $72.

answer:  To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original total cost of the 2 shirts.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the original total cost to find the final price.

1. The original total cost of the 2 shirts is:
   \[
   2 \text{ shirts} \times \$30 \text{ per shirt} = \$60
   \]

2. The discount amount is 40% of the original total cost:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$60 = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24
   \]

3. Subtract the discount amount from the original total cost to find the final price:
   \[
   \$60 - \$24 = \$36
   \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts after the 40% discount.

answer:  First, let's determine the weight of each animal based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

Total weight = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird + Container
Total weight = 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds + 20 pounds
Total weight = 260 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.

answer:  Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies taken by her son and her husband:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of cookies taken by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, Jenny eats:
\[ 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Jenny eats 9 cookies.

answer:  To find the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

answer:  To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
2. Add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses.
3. Subtract the total number of plant pots used from the number of plant pots April bought.

First, let's calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the roses require twice as many plant pots as the daisies, we have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses} \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of plant pots used from the number of plant pots April bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots} \]

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final number of plant pots left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]

1. Calculate the initial number of balls Josh was juggling at the end of the fourth week.
2. Subtract the number of balls he dropped and lost.
3. Add the balls that were caught by the crowd.

1. **Initial number of balls:**
   - Josh starts juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week.
   - By the end of the fourth week, he is juggling \(3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\) balls.

2. **balls dropped and lost:**
   - Josh drops 3 balls.
   - He loses 1 ball completely.
   - Total balls dropped and lost: \(3 + 1 = 4\) balls.

3. **balls caught by the crowd:**
   - 2 balls are caught by the crowd.
   - Total balls he has left: \(4 - 2 = 2\) balls.

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 2 balls.

So, the number of balls Josh starts to juggle on stage is 2 balls.

1. **Monday:**
   - Yoga class: 1 hour

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Cooking class: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga class
   - Cooking class = 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours

4. **Thursday:**
   - Museum tour: Half as long as the cooking class
   - Museum tour = 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours

5. **Friday:**
   - Errands: 2 hours

Now, we add up all the durations:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total duration = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours

Therefore, all Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours.

Next, calculate the total cost of treats per month: $20/month.

Then, calculate the total cost of medicine per month: $100/month.

Now, add up all the costs to find the total monthly cost: $100/month + $20/month + $100/month = $<<100+20+100=220>>220/month.

Finally, calculate the total annual cost by multiplying the monthly cost by 12: $220/month * 12 months/year = $<<220*12=2640>>2640/year.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year.

answer:  To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of the second tree.
2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Use the combined height to find the height of the tallest tree.

First, let's find the height of the second tree:
- The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
- The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree.
- Therefore, the height of the second tree is \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) feet.

Next, we calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
- The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
- The second tree is 11 feet tall.
- The combined height of the shortest and second trees is \( 6 + 11 = 17 \) feet.

Finally, the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined:
- Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) feet.

So, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

answer:  To determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we first need to find the cost of each juice box.

1. Juice Box A costs $4.
2. Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A:
   \[
   \text{Juice Box B} = \text{Juice Box A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A:
   \[
   \text{Juice Box C} = \text{Juice Box A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Juice Box C and Juice Box B:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Juice Box C} - \text{Juice Box B} = 11 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars}

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings:
\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Annabelle already has $80 in savings. Adding her total earnings to her savings gives us her total savings:
\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.
\[ \boxed{45} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time John spent on each activity:

1. Boating: 6 hours
2. Swimming: Half of the time spent boating, which is \( 6 / 2 = 3 \) hours
3. Watching shows: 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

According to the problem, the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time spent. Let \( T \) be the total time spent. Then:

\[ 6 = 0.30T \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent a total of 20 hours on his vacation.

Next, we know that John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

answer:  First, calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors} \times \$100 \text{ per tractor} = \$1000 \]

Next, calculate the daily revenue from silos:
\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos} \times \$220 \text{ per silo} = \$1100 \]

Now, determine the increase in daily revenue:
\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

Finally, calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Daily revenue from tractors}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money Billy had left after buying the gumballs. He started with $10 and spent $2 on gumballs:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so he spent half of $8:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Billy spent $4 on candy. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{8}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, Billy bought 2 pounds of candy.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Marisa spends each day from buying lollipops. She buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa saves each day. She receives $5 in pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, let's find out how much money Marisa saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, after saving some money, Andrea spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Since she had $36 in the beginning, the amount of money she had after spending $15 is:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

This $21 is the amount she had after saving some money. Therefore, the amount she saved is:
\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes for John to drive to his friend's house:
- Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
- Speed: 70 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

Next, calculate the time it takes for John to drive home:
- Distance home: 240 miles
- Speed: 80 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, add the time for the detour:
- Detour distance: 10 miles
- Detour speed: 70 mph
- Detour time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

Finally, add up all the times to get the total trip time:
- Total time = Time to friend's house + Time home + Detour time
- Total time = 0.5 hours + 3 hours + 0.5 hours = 4 hours

Therefore, the trip took John 4 hours.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants to include:

1. Mini-golf: $5 per round
2. Arcade tokens: $5
3. Go-karts: $10 per ride * 2 rides = $20

Adding these together:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $20

Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan has a budget of $90. Let's see how much money she has left for the activities:
- Total budget: $90
- Total cost of activities: $30

Remaining money = $90 - $30 = $60

Now, let's assume each friend gets the same amount of money for activities. We need to find out how many friends she can invite with the remaining $60.

If each friend gets $30 for activities, then the number of friends she can invite is:
- Remaining money / Cost per friend = $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

\[
\frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds. Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing:

\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds. Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing:

\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, add the total amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:

\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Mark needs a total of 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for each reason:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of mask-wearers minus 5:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of people kicked out for these specific reasons:
\[
3 + 7 + 21 = 31
\]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the specific reasons from the total number of people kicked out:
\[
50 - 31 = 19
\]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance of one round trip:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city to the first city: (75 + 100) - 50 = 125 miles

The total distance for one round trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The train makes 3 round trips a day, so the total distance traveled per day is:
\[ 3 \times 300 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it needs to travel by the distance it travels per day:
\[ \frac{18000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

answer:  Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, and this is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find the age of Carver's son, we need to solve this equation for \( x \).

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
   \[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

answer:  To determine the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test to pass, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total points Jane has scored on the first two tests.
2. Determine the total points she needs to achieve to pass.
3. Subtract the points she has already scored from the total points needed to find the minimum points required on the third test.

First, let's calculate the total points Jane has scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 \text{ points} + 18 \text{ points} = 33 \text{ points} \]

Next, we know she needs a total of at least 42 points to pass:
\[ 42 \text{ points} \]

Now, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points needed to find the minimum points required on the third test:
\[ 42 \text{ points} - 33 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \text{ points} \]

Number of girls = 6
Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls = 2 * 6 = 12

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys = 6 + 12 = 18

So, there are 18 kids in the park.

answer:  To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then sum them up.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Saturday = 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday = 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
   - However, six pairs were returned, so the net number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, we sum up the number of pairs sold each day:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

Therefore, the store sold 50 pairs of tennis shoes by the end of the sale.

answer:  To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fourth-grade boys.
2. Determine the number of fourth-grade boys absent on Friday.
3. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present on Friday.

First, let's find the total number of fourth-grade boys:
- Total number of fourth-graders = 96
- Number of fourth-grade girls = 43

Number of fourth-grade boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of fourth-grade girls
Number of fourth-grade boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Next, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday.

Now, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present on Friday:
Number of fourth-grade boys present = Number of fourth-grade boys - Number of fourth-grade boys absent
Number of fourth-grade boys present = 53 - 4 = 49

Therefore, there were 49 fourth-grade boys present at Small Tree School on Friday.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper.
2. Determine the amount saved by the DIY project.
3. Subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost.

1. The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.
2. The DIY project saves 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20:
   \[
   400 \times 0.20 = 80
   \]
   So, the amount saved by the DIY project is $80.
3. Subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost:
   \[
   400 - 80 = 320
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of the picture frames for all seniors:
44 seniors * $20 per picture frame = $880

Next, calculate the additional cost for etching each picture frame:
$20 * 20% = $4 per picture frame

Now, calculate the total cost for the etched picture frames:
44 seniors * ($20 + $4) per picture frame = $996

Then, calculate the cost of the pins for the 2 seniors who will receive them:
2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

Finally, calculate the number of officers who will receive cords:
44 seniors * 1/4 = 11 officers

Now, calculate the cost of the cords for the officers:
11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Finally, add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:
$880 (picture frames) + $996 (etched picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (ords) = $2018

The total cost is $2018.

answer:  To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Sara's points.
2. Calculate Erin's current points, which is three times Sara's points.
3. Subtract the 14 points Erin scored from her current points to find her original points.

Let's start with Sara's points:
\[ \text{Sara's points} = 8 \]

Next, we calculate Erin's current points:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} \]
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the 14 points Erin scored from her current points to find her original points:
\[ \text{Erin's original points} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{Points scored} \]
\[ \text{Erin's original points} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

\[ \boxed{10} \]

\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = \$240,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \( \$240,000 \).

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours for each day.

- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: Twice as long as Tuesday's class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours

Adding these together:

1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

Therefore, Hallie had dance practice for 5 hours a week.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. Since she has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the cups. Since each cup sells for $1:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, let's calculate the profit per hour. Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of supplies from the total revenue. Millie spends $18 on supplies:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so her profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = \$4.50 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $4.50 per hour of operation.

answer:  To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the total number of socks from the pairs:
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
- Each pair consists of 2 socks.
- Therefore, the total number of socks from the pairs is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) socks.

Next, let's add the loose socks:
- Lindsay washes 15 loose socks.
- Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is \( 20 + 15 = 35 \) socks.

Now, let's subtract the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing:
- The total number of socks that need washing is 50.
- The total number of socks she has washed is 35.
- Therefore, the number of socks she has missed is \( 50 - 35 = 15 \) socks.

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

\[
\boxed{15}

answer:  To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy made $56 from selling the apples.
   - The price per apple is $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) apples.

Now, we sum up the number of apples picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total number of apples = \( 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \) apples.

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50.

answer:  To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- There are 6 erasers.
- Total cost of erasers = 6 erasers * $2/eraser = $<<6*2=12>>12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- There are 8 pencils.
- Total cost of pencils = 8 pencils * $3/pencil = $<<8*3=24>>24.

Now, we add the total cost of the erasers and the total cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of erasers + Cost of pencils
- Total cost = $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36.

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

answer:  To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time: 8 hours

Distance_Cho = Speed × Time
Distance_Cho = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time: 5 hours

Distance_Chloe = Speed × Time
Distance_Chloe = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance_Cho - Distance_Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

answer:  Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combine like terms:

\[11x = 165\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\)
- Sam's popsicles: \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\).

answer:  To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total interest over the five months.
2. Divide the total interest by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10%, and the principal amount is $3,650.

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 1825 \]

Next, we divide the total interest by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Interest}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{1825}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 365 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $365 per month.

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of girls performing is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it to the show:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Number of girls performing = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Total number of people singing = 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16

answer:  First, calculate the total number of pre-made Valentine's cards Erica's dad brought her:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ cards per box} = 30 \text{ cards} \]

Next, add the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards:
\[ 20 \text{ cards} + 30 \text{ cards} = 50 \text{ cards} \]

Then, subtract the cards she passed out:
\[ 50 \text{ cards} - 24 \text{ cards} - 5 \text{ cards} = 21 \text{ cards} \]

Finally, add the cards she received:
\[ 21 \text{ cards} + 17 \text{ cards} = 38 \text{ cards} \]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers.

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has 12 gifts to wrap.

Next, we need to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift. She has 144 inches of ribbon in total.

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

answer:  Let \( x \) be the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he had \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.

We know that after selling the land, he had 12.8 hectares left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

answer:  To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Beth's age.
2. Determine Alice's age.
3. Calculate the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, let's find Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, let's find Alice's age:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Now, we calculate the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars/ride} \]

Since there are 9 rides:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David to buy a ride bracelet for all 9 rides.

A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets.

The total cost for Dasha to buy tickets is $36.
The total cost for David to buy a ride bracelet is $30.

The savings is:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu, and then sum these amounts.

1. James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
2. James delivers \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

First, calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu:
\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson}
\]
\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
\]
\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = 22
\]

Next, add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[
\text{Total messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu}
\]
\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, James delivers a total of \(88\) messages.

\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts/day} \]

If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts/day} \]

The difference in energy usage per day is:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts/day} - 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 4500 \text{ watts/day} \]

Over 30 days, he will save:
\[ 4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts} = 13.5 \text{ kilowatts} \]

Therefore, Mel will save 13.5 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

answer:  To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Millipedes:**
   - Nancy saw \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many millipedes as spiders.
   - Number of millipedes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).

3. **Stink bugs:**
   - The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   - Number of stink bugs = \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, we add up all the bugs:
- Number of spiders = 90
- Number of millipedes = 30
- Number of stink bugs = 48

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs.

- Recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
- Editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Next, find the total time spent on all activities:
- Total time = Writing + Recording + Editing
- Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
- Total time = 7.5 hours

Now, calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100%
- Percentage spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100%
- Percentage spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100%
- Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100%
- Percentage spent editing = 20%

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services without the discount:

- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu: $10 per month
- Disney Plus: $10 per month

Total cost without discount = $10 + $10 + $10 = $30 per month

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling:

Discount amount = 20% of $30 = 0.20 * $30 = $6

Total cost with discount = $30 - $6 = $24 per month

Now, let's compare the total cost of the streaming services with the cost of the cable package:

- Cable package: $60 per month
- Streaming services: $24 per month

Savings per month = $60 - $24 = $36

To find out how much Tim saves in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12:

Annual savings = $36 * 12 = $432

Therefore, Tim saves $432 a year by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services.

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps} \]

He then takes another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So far, he has taken:

Since he has already taken 6,000 steps, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

\[ 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Elliott took 2000 steps during his jog.

answer:  Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk required for a normal batch. A normal batch calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.

For a quadruple batch:
- Flour: 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so for 12 cups of flour, Mark needs:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so for 4 cups of milk, Mark needs:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk

#### 4
Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

answer:  To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money to buy the bike, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save.
2. Determine how much money Mark already has.
3. Calculate the additional amount Mark needs to save.
4. Determine how many days it will take for Mark to save the additional amount.

1. The total amount of money Mark needs to save is $300.
2. Mark already has $50 in his bank account.
3. The additional amount Mark needs to save is the difference between the total amount needed and the amount he already has:
   \[
   300 - 50 = 250
   \]
4. Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save the additional $250, we divide the additional amount by his daily earnings:
   \[
   \frac{250}{10} = 25
   \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save his money for 25 days to have enough to buy the bike that costs $300.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of slices given away:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the slices given away from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, Jenny eats 2 slices:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, there are 3 slices left.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages before the discount:
- The first package is worth $400.
- The second package is worth twice as much as the first, so it is worth 2 * $400 = $800.
- The total cost before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount:
- The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
- The total cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework:
- The finale firework costs $150.
- The total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent a total of $1110.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of corns Allan initially had. Since he has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new number of corns is:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, let's find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. The new number of cannolis is 100, and the new number of corns is 60. Therefore, the combined total is:

\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]

answer:  To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:**
   - The builder works 4 weeks every month.
   - The builder works 6 days every week.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a month is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) days.

2. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a year is \( 24 \times 12 = 288 \) days.

3. **Calculate the builder's annual earnings:**
   - The builder gets paid $50 every day.
   - Therefore, the annual earnings are \( 288 \times 50 = 14,400 \) dollars.

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

answer:  To determine how many calories John consumed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk John drank.
2. Determine the number of calories per ounce of milk.
3. Multiply the total amount of milk by the calories per ounce.

First, let's calculate the total amount of milk John drank:
- Each glass of milk is 8 ounces.
- John drinks 2 glasses of milk.

So, the total amount of milk is:
\[ 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce.

Now, we multiply the total amount of milk by the calories per ounce:
\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories.

answer:  Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \( x \).

Joanne gathers:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- 15 apples from the shortest trees (half of 30)
- \( x \) apples from the average trees

Her sister gathers:
- 2 \times 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees
- 3 \times 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees
- 0 apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 140 + x = 500 \]

Subtracting 140 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 140 \]
\[ x = 360 \]

So, Joanne gathered 360 apples from the average trees. #### 360

answer:  Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy at a rate of "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." This means she paid for 1 pound at $3 and got the other pound at $1.50.

The cost for the taffy is:
\[ 1 \times 3 + 1 \times 1.50 = 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

The cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Adding up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10 and spent $7.00, so she has:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left.

answer:  Each sandwich serves 4 people, so to serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he will need:
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the cost for 5 pounds of meat is:
- 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the cost for 5 pounds of cheese is:
- 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost for the meat and cheese is:
- $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

answer:  To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to find the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
   - One zebra with half as many stripes as \(36\): \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

   Adding these together:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. Count the number of zebras:
   - There are 4 zebras.

3. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22 stripes.

\text{Difference in elevation} = \text{Elevation of Stanley's comb} - \text{Oliver's current elevation}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in elevation} = 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in elevation} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

answer:  To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse.
2. Determine the discounted price per blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

**Step 1: Calculate the discount amount per blouse.**

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount. Therefore, the discount amount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

**Step 2: Determine the discounted price per blouse.**

The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

**Step 3: Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.**

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]

answer:  In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. Therefore, the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 48000 \text{ dollars} \]

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained. The number of employees who remained is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The total amount paid in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money paid in the two months is:
\[ 48000 \text{ dollars} + 36000 \text{ dollars} = 84000 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of words in the book:
- The book has 45 pages.
- Each page averages 200 words.
- Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 90000 words.

Next, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book:
- Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
- Time to read the book = 90000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes for Toby to get to the airport:
- It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
- Total time Toby will spend at the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he will spend at the airport from the required time:
- 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

answer:  First, let's determine the original cost of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans and the tattered jeans cost $28, the original cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which means he saved:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so he saved:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

from the tattered jeans.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

answer:  To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's and Zack's lockers.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, the size of Zack's locker is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will consume in 30 days.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Therefore, in 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, and 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are required to make 60 cookies.

To do this, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

answer:  To determine how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are more likely to explode.
2. Determine how many of these more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that are more likely to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are more likely to explode.

\[ \text{Number of more likely to explode candles} = 50000 \times 0.01 = 5000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 5000 \times 0.05 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 250.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his cards, so he sells \(\frac{2}{3}\) of his cards. The number of cards he sells is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \]

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{3}{3}x \]

Kenny needs enough money to buy a ticket that costs $100 and an additional $50 for spending. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{3}x = 150 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \times \frac{3}{3} = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards.

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( c \):
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, substitute \( c = 180 - d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( d \):
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 304 = d \]
\[ 56 = d \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the next 2 days:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \text{ km} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the second week:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Finally, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 8 months at the normal price of $12 per month:
\[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12 \text{ per month} = \$96 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost for the last 8 months at the increased price of $14 per month:
\[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14 \text{ per month} = \$112 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost for one year:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

Since we need the cost for 2 years, we multiply the cost of one year by 2:
\[ \$256 \times 2 = \$512 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service is:
\[ \$512 \]

answer:  First, calculate the total number of cats carried away by the four boats:
\[ 4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats per boat} = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Next, subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats on the rock:
\[ 50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Then, determine how many of the remaining cats ran after the mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cats} = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Finally, subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 \text{ cats} - 18 \text{ cats} = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

answer:  To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we add up all the money Dora currently has:
- She has saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Dora currently has $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

answer:  To determine the total cost Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price.
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) dollar.
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - The cost of the cake is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11

#### Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

answer:  First, determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second company. The second company gave him twice as much as the first bank:

\[ \text{Amount from second company} = 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both sources:

\[ \text{Total amount received} = 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Finally, add the initial capital to the total amount received to find the new capital:

\[ \text{New capital} = 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

1. Buses:
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

2. Minibusses:
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

3. Minivans:
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees in total.

answer:  Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.
Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, so the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
Each self-made feeder attracts 10 more birds than each store-bought feeder, so each self-made feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.
The total number of birds attracted by the self-made feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.
Therefore, Lillian can expect to see a total of 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

1. Set of pot and pans: $120.00
2. Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
3. 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars

Adding these together:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

So, the total cost before the discount is $165.00.

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165 = 33 \]

The discount amount is $33.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 165 - 33 = 132 \]

So, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

1. Identify the number of letters in Indras' name.
2. Calculate the number of letters in Indras' sister's name based on the given relationship.
3. Add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name.

Step 1: Indras' name has 6 letters.

Step 2: Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
So, the number of letters in Indras' sister's name is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Step 3: Add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name:
\[ 6 \text{ (Indras' name)} + 7 \text{ (sister's name)} = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras' and her sister's names is \(\boxed{13}\).

1. **Wayne's Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's Travel Time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Desired Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's effective travel time is \( 16 - 5 = 11 \) minutes.

4. **Difference in Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's effective travel time is 11 minutes.
   - The difference in travel time is \( 11 - 4 = 7 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 7 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne.

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests} \]

Each of these 18 guests would have two hotdogs, so:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, so:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs} \]

The total number of hotdogs consumed is:

\[ 36 + 80 = 116 \text{ hotdogs} \]

The total number of hotdogs prepared is:

\[ 36 \times 1 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 116 - 36 = 80 \text{ hotdogs} \]

Therefore, \( 80 \) guests did not get a second hotdog.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He had 1% of his money left:

\[ 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars:

\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent a total of $500, the amount of money he spent on candy bars:

\[ 500 - 125 = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{375}{75} = 5 \text{ candy bars} \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

answer:  To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the sequence of actions step by step.

1. **Prince Thaddeus:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

2. **Prince Arthur:**
   - Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - Calculate the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons}
     \]

3. **Prince Walter:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Calculate the number of dragons Prince Walter slew:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons}
     \]

4. **Prince Bruce:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - Calculate the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons}
     \]

Therefore, Prince Bruce has slain **30** dragons.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, we calculate:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Josey used. Since she used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Jon took for the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have taken 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes
- Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so 80 + 5 = 85 minutes
- Run: Let's denote the time James took for the run as R minutes.

Total time for James = 36 + 85 + R = 160 minutes

Solving for R:
121 + R = 160
R = 160 - 121
R = 39

James took 39 minutes for the run.

answer:  To determine the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide by the number of servings.

1. **Cost of onions:**
   - The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount, so he uses 4 pounds of onions.
   - The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound.
   - Total cost for onions = 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00

2. **Cost of beef stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - The cost of beef stock is $2.00 per box.
   - Total cost for beef stock = 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

4. **Cost per serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.
   - Cost per serving = $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00

answer:  To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight of each piece of cake.
2. Determine the total weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom.
3. Subtract the total weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake.

1. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
   \]

2. Rory and her mom each take one piece, so the total weight of the pieces taken is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. Subtract the weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake:
   \[
   20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 friends, so there are:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

people in total.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.

answer:  Marcus starts with the house at 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and each hour increases the temperature by 5 degrees. So, the temperature increase from baking is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the cooling effect over 30 minutes is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this from the current temperature:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

For Elizabeth:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 beads + 40 beads = 60 beads

For Margareth:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 beads + 80 beads = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between Elizabeth and Margareth:
- Elizabeth's total beads: 60 beads
- Margareth's total beads: 140 beads
- Difference: 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

So, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

answer:  To determine how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost per balloon.
2. Determine the new cost per balloon after the increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the original cost per balloon:
- Total cost to fill 20 balloons: $900
- Original cost per balloon: $900 / 20 = $45

Next, let's find the new cost per balloon after the increase:
- Increase in cost per balloon: $20
- New cost per balloon: $45 + $20 = $65

Now, let's calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:
- New cost per balloon: $65
- Number of balloons: 170
- Total cost: $65 * 170 = $10950

Therefore, Bentley paid $10950 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:

\[ 4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 \text{ eggs} + 2 \text{ eggs} = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray can hold 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A was 20 minutes long.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour.

30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse consumes. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile:

Number of bails = 16 miles * (1/2) bail/mile = 8 bails

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3:

Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has a total of:

Total money = 6 bills * $5/bill = $30

Finally, we calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6

Therefore, Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.

answer:  First, calculate the volume of one raised bed:
- Volume of one raised bed = width * length * height
- Volume of one raised bed = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet
- Volume of one raised bed = 32 cubic feet

Next, calculate the total volume needed for all 10 raised beds:
- Total volume needed = number of raised beds * volume of one raised bed
- Total volume needed = 10 raised beds * 32 cubic feet/bed
- Total volume needed = 320 cubic feet

Now, determine how many bags of potting soil are needed:
- Number of bags needed = total volume needed / volume per bag
- Number of bags needed = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
- Number of bags needed = 160 bags

Finally, calculate the total cost of the potting soil:
- Total cost = number of bags needed * cost per bag
- Total cost = 160 bags * $12/bag
- Total cost = $1920

So, the total cost of the potting soil for Bob is $1920.

answer:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

First, let's calculate the total cost if you buy the super ticket:
- Super ticket: $20
- Additional soda: $1
- Total cost with super ticket: \( 20 + 1 = 21 \)

Next, let's calculate the total cost if you buy the regular ticket:
- Movie ticket: $12
- Cost of popcorn: \( P \)
- Cost of soda: $3
- Total cost with regular ticket: \( 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \)

According to the problem, by not buying the super ticket, you saved $2. Therefore, the difference between the cost of the super ticket and the cost of the regular ticket is $2:
\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - 2 = P \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

answer:  To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of colors in the six packets that each have eight pieces of colors:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ colors/packet} = 48 \text{ colors} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of colors in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces of colors:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ colors/packet} = 64 \text{ colors} \]

Now, we add the number of colors from both types of packets to get the total number of colors:
\[ 48 \text{ colors} + 64 \text{ colors} = 112 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons.

answer:  To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the initial cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each.
- Revenue from flash sale = 17 sneakers * $20/sneaker = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the remaining sneakers:
- The salesman sold the remaining 31 sneakers at $25 each.
- Revenue from remaining sneakers = 31 sneakers * $25/sneaker = $775

Now, let's find the total revenue from all the sales:
- Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from remaining sneakers
- Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost
- Profit = $1115 - $576 = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:

Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip ≈ 2.00 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to transport all the feed.

Therefore, the farmer needs 3 trips.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in one day.
2. Calculate the total number of apples both people eat in one day.
3. Calculate the total number of apples both people eat in 30 days.

First, we know that each person eats 4 apples a day.

Next, since there are two people (Marin and Nancy), the total number of apples they eat in one day is:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \]

Finally, to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples they eat in one day by the number of days:
\[ 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]

answer:  To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled during each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second segment:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Next, let's find the total distance and the total time:

- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:

- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
- Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph.

Next, calculate the value of the remaining sapphires:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Now, calculate the number of rubies Jenna receives:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \]

Then, calculate the value of the rubies:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Finally, add the value of the sapphires and rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
\[ \$4000 \text{ (sapphires)} + \$2400 \text{ (rubies)} = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

answer:  To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the pizza.
2. Determine the tip amount.
3. Add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pizza.
The cost of the pizza is given as $15.

Step 2: Determine the tip amount.
The tip is 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Step 3: Add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount.
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Cost of the pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18.

answer:  To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

answer:  To find the total number of cards, we need to determine the number of red, green, and yellow cards and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Number of red cards = 15
   - Number of green cards = 24
   - Number of yellow cards = \( 15 + 24 = 39 \)

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Total cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
   - Total cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \)

answer:  To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we first need to calculate the number of pieces of laundry in one room and then multiply that by 80.

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we add up all the pieces of laundry in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total per room: \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\) pieces of laundry

For 80 rooms:
- \(15 \times 80 = 1200\) pieces of laundry

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fairies seen by Katelyn:**
   Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

2. **Fairies joining from the east:**
   One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   So, 25 fairies joined from the east.

3. **Total number of fairies after new fairies joined:**
   Adding the new fairies to the initial number of fairies:
   \[
   50 + 25 = 75
   \]

4. **Fairies flying away:**
   Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Subtracting these from the total number of fairies:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45
   \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils} \]

Next, we find out how many pencils were used after two months:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 \text{ pencils} = 60 \text{ pencils} \]

So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 \text{ pencils} - 60 \text{ pencils} = 240 \text{ pencils} \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 \text{ pencils} = 80 \text{ pencils} \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ 240 \text{ pencils} - 80 \text{ pencils} = 80 \text{ pencils} \]

answer:  To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem:

1. Frederick has 10 plants.
2. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.
3. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.

First, let's calculate how many plants Toni has:
- Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.
- Frederick has 10 plants.
- 60% of 10 plants is \( 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \) plants.
- Therefore, Toni has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) plants.

Next, let's calculate how many plants Shondra has:
- Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.
- Toni has 16 plants.
- Therefore, Shondra has \( 16 - 7 = 9 \) plants.

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

answer:  To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles.
2. Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:

- Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth 2 cents.
  - Earnings from aluminum cans per week = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

- Grayson recycles 5 plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
  - Earnings from plastic bottles per week = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:

- Total earnings for a four-week month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling plastic bottles in a four-week month.

answer:  To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the total number of days to find the daily walking time.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk in three weeks:
- Jason walks 4 days a week.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in three weeks, he walks:
  \[
  4 \text{ days/week} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, we divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the total number of days (84 days) to find the daily walking time:
\[
\frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{84 \text{ days}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ minutes/day}
\]

So, Jason has to spend \(\frac{20}{7}\) minutes walking each day.

answer:  To determine the amount of change Theo received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
2. Find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2, so:
\[ \text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Step 2: Find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper.
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the pen} + \text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier.
Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3.

answer:  Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she can decorate, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes per pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

answer:  To determine how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to account for the shoes he loses and gains throughout the week.

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes gained on Monday**: He gains 5 pairs of shoes.
   \[
   200 + 5 = 205
   \]

3. **Shoes gained on Wednesday**: He gains 15 new pairs of shoes.
   \[
   205 + 15 = 220
   \]

4. **Shoes gained on Friday**: He gains 30 more pairs of shoes.
   \[
   220 + 30 = 250
   \]

5. **Shoes lost on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes.
   \[
   250 - 180 = 70
   \]

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 70 shoes on Sunday.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]

answer:  To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is: 2 * $5000 = $10000.

2. **Hotel:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is: $1500 + (0.20 * $1500) = $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is: $1800 * 3 = $5400.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost of the trip is: $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( T \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students who have a desktop computer is \( \frac{3}{4}T \).

The number of students who do not have a desktop computer is given as 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ T - \frac{3}{4}T = 20 \]

To solve for \( T \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[ \frac{4}{4}T - \frac{3}{4}T = 20 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4}T = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{1}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{1} \):

\[ T = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ T = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80} \).

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the remoras to the same units as the shark's length. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the shark's length from feet to inches:

10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}

Next, we calculate the total length of the remoras:

2 \text{ remoras} \times 6 \text{ inches/remora} = 12 \text{ inches}

Now, we find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's length}} \right) \times 100

\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100

\text{Percentage} = 10\%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length.

answer:  Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Therefore, the total number of cookies he can have is:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 3 \cdot 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

answer:  To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides} \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 621 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:
\[ 621 \]

answer:  To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel, we first need to calculate the number of songs each person can add to their player.

Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, and he currently has 20 songs. Therefore, the number of songs he can add is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, and she currently has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Since Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of songs Luri can add is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his player.

answer:  To determine how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- \( D \) is the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) is the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |D| = 9 \)
- \( |P| = 6 \)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \)

The principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets states:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Since there are 32 kids in the class, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

answer:  To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received.

First, let's find the total number of books Sarah bought:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}}
\]

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15}
\]

\[
\text{Total number of books} = 20
\]

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received:

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of children}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{20}{4}
\]

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = 5
\]

So, each child received 5 books.

answer:  To determine how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal of $200, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned by both Keegan and Tasha.
2. Subtract the total amount earned from the goal to find out how much more they need to earn.

First, let's find the total amount of money earned by Keegan and Tasha:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Keegan's earnings} + \text{Tasha's earnings} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 83 + 91 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 174 \]

Next, we subtract the total amount earned from the goal to find out how much more they need to earn:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Total earnings} \]
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 174 \]
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 26 \]

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn $26 to reach their goal.

- Therefore, one horse consumes 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day:
- Each horse consumes 10 pounds/day.
- There are 4 horses.
- Therefore, four horses consume 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in five days:
- Four horses consume 40 pounds/day.
- Over five days, they consume 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Finally, let's determine how many bags of oats are needed:
- Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
- Total bags needed = 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his four horses for five days.

answer:  To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the weight of the 2010 penny.
2. Add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny.

First, we know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny is:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Next, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 36 \text{ grains} + 48 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the combined weight of the 2010 penny and 1959 penny is 84 grains.

answer:  To determine how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow paint tubes he possesses based on the information given.

1. **Blue Paint:**
   - Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.
   - Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   - Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.
   - Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total number of tubes:

\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = \text{Blue paint} + \text{Yellow paint} \]
\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = 2 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = 11 \]

So, Jasper has a total of 11 tubes of paint.

2. Convert the total distance into hours based on his running speed.

First, let's calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
- James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.
- Total distance per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Next, we need to convert this distance into hours.
- James runs 10 miles per hour.
- Total hours per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours a week.

answer:  To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays.
2. Subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays:
- Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
- Jaime has 2 trays.

So, the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs:
- Jaime has 64 eggs in total.
- He can place 48 eggs on the trays.

So, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the trays is:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.
2. Determine the amount of money Stetson gave up based on the number of oranges he ate.

First, let's find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Stetson picked 60 oranges and ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them:

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Next, Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
\text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

answer:  To determine the total number of minutes Charisma walks in 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of minutes Charisma walks in one hour.
2. Calculate the number of minutes Charisma walks in one day.
3. Calculate the number of minutes Charisma walks in 5 days.

First, we know that Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she is at work. Since she works for 8 hours every day, we can calculate the number of minutes she walks in one day as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days. We do this by multiplying the number of minutes she walks in one day by 5:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.

\( \boxed{200} \)

answer:  To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest temperatures for all three countries.
2. Add the highest temperatures together.
3. Divide the sum by the number of countries to find the average.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, add these temperatures together:
\[ -48 + 21 + (-3) \]

First, add -48 and 21:
\[ -48 + 21 = -27 \]

Next, add -3 to the result:
\[ -27 + (-3) = -30 \]

Now, divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3):
\[ \frac{-30}{3} = -10 \]

So, the average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

- Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders * 64" = 256"
- Second layer: 3 cheerleaders * 64" = 192"
- Third layer: 2 cheerleaders * 64" = 128"
- Top layer: 1 cheerleader * 60" = 60"

Next, sum the heights of all the layers to find the total height of the human pyramid:
- Total height = 256" + 192" + 128" + 60" = 636"

Finally, convert the total height from inches to feet:
- Total height = 636" / 12" per foot = 53 feet

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

answer:  Let's denote the number of guests as \( n \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food per person is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5n \).

For the second venue:
- The cost per person is $25.
- The cost of food per person is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25n \).

To find the number of guests \( n \) that makes the two costs equal, we set up the equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( n = 10 \).

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, let's determine how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both Brianne and Ashley brought together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:
\[ 120 \text{ oranges} \div 3 \text{ oranges/pie} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies.

answer:  First, determine the total number of razors Heather gets from 2 packs of 4 razors each:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

Next, apply the buy one get one free deal:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ razors}}{2} = 4 \text{ razors} \]

Now, calculate the total cost before the coupon:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00 \]

Apply the $2.00 coupon:
\[ \$8.00 - \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Finally, determine the cost per razor:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{4 \text{ razors}} = \$1.50 \text{ per razor} \]

Convert the cost per razor to cents:
\[ \$1.50 \times 100 = 150 \text{ cents} \]

Each razor costs 150 cents.

answer:  To determine the length of the couch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the width of the chair.
2. Calculate the width of the rug based on the given relationship.
3. Calculate the length of the couch based on the given relationship.

1. The width of the chair is given as 3 feet.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, the width of the rug is:
   \[
   \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we calculate twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Then, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:
   \[
   \text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

The couch is 18 feet long.

answer:  To determine Angela's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Brett's current age.
2. Determine Brett's age in four years.
3. Calculate Angela's age in four years based on the given relationship.
4. Find Angela's current age by subtracting four years from her age in four years.

1. **Brett's current age**: Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. **Brett's age in four years**: In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. **Angela's age in four years**: According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old.
4. **Angela's current age**: To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years. So, Angela's current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\) years old.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

answer:  To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts requested by each group of friends and then add the additional gifts she decided to buy.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts requested by the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of gifts requested by the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Now, let's add the gifts requested by both groups:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Finally, let's add the additional 10 gifts Cherrie decided to buy:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of \( 26 \) gifts.

answer:  Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \). According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, which is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

- Morning rides: 2
- Afternoon rides: 2
- Total rides per day: 2 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 4 rides/day

Next, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days: 4 rides/day * 14 days = 56 rides

Now, calculate the cost of each type of ride:
- Morning rides: $6 per ride
- Afternoon rides: $2 per ride

Calculate the total cost for each type of ride:
- Total cost for morning rides: 56 rides * $6/ride = $336
- Total cost for afternoon rides: 56 rides * $2/ride = $112

Finally, calculate the total cost for all rides:
- Total cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $336 + $112 = $448

So, Paul spent $448 on driving his car during these two weeks.

answer:  To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her weekly bus trips.

Janet takes two bus trips per day for five days a week:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, if Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

answer:  Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each leg needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ 24 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ pairs per leg} = 48 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 48 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$576.00 \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $576.00.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2x \) dollars.

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2.

She bought one pack of green apple gum for half the cost of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry gum, grape gum, and green apple gum:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \text{Yards used by grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ \text{Total yards used} = 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

answer:  To determine how much money Gerald has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.
2. Subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings.

First, let's calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week:
- Gerald earns $30 per day.
- He worked for an entire week, which is 7 days.

So, his total earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
- Gerald spent $100.

So, the amount he has left is:
\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals on the farm and at the zoo, we need to calculate the number of cows and sheep at each location and then sum them up.

First, let's find the number of cows at the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
- Therefore, the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.

Next, let's find the number of sheep on the farm:
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
- Therefore, the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Finally, we add the total number of animals from both locations:
- Total animals = 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120

answer:  Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th. Today is December 31st. 

First, let's calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- From December 31st to January 31st: 31 days
- From February 1st to February 28th: 28 days
- From March 1st to June 30th: 60 days
- From July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 60 + 19 = 138 days

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 138 days = 750 calories/day

answer:  To determine Tara's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags:
- Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each.
- Each pack contains 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
- The total cost is \(40 \times 4 = 160\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:
- Tara sold each canvas bag for $8.
- She sold 40 canvas bags, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $320 - $160 = $160

Therefore, Tara's profit is $160.

answer:  To determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to compare the cost and quantity of sticks for each type of wood.

1. **2 x 4 piece of wood:**
   - Cost: $4
   - Sticks: 200
   - Cost per stick: $4 / 200 = $0.20 per stick

2. **2 x 8 piece of wood:**
   - Cost: $6
   - Sticks: 400
   - Cost per stick: $6 / 400 = $0.15 per stick

Since Frederick has $24 to spend, he should buy the 2 x 8 piece of wood because it has a cheaper cost per stick.

Let's calculate the number of sticks he can get with $24:

- Total cost: $24
- Stick cost: $0.15 per stick
- Number of sticks: $24 / $0.15 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the cheapest lumber is 1600.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Convert the total distance to kilometers.
3. Calculate the amount of water needed based on the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run:
- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- She needs to run 8 laps.

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Next, we convert the total distance to kilometers:
- Total distance = 2 km

Now, we calculate the amount of water needed based on the total distance:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- Total distance = 2 km.

Water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

answer:  Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Therefore, Rose bought \( 4O \) onions and \( 4P \) potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

Solving for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes:
\[ O + P = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

2. Subtract the loaves sold in the morning: 93 loaves.
3. Subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon: 39 loaves.
4. Add the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store: 6 loaves.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Total loaves baked: 200 loaves
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93 loaves
   \[
   200 - 93 = 107

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed for one grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total skeins for one grandchild = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:

19 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 57 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool.

answer:  First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked by all four per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29 quarts.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint a whole house in 24 hours/day * 10 days = 240 hours.
If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 hours / 5 = 48 hours.

answer:  To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for both the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson buys 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for red tulips = 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson buys 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for blue tulips = 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to get the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 rows (red tulips) + 3 rows (blue tulips) = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers:**
   \[
   48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than got off.
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66
\]

answer:  Initially, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
After adding the new device, her daily consumption will increase by 2 kilowatts per hour, making her new daily consumption 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.

First, let's calculate the daily cost before and after adding the new device:
- Initial daily cost: 12 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $18
- New daily cost: 14 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $21

Next, let's calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device:
- Initial weekly cost: $18/day * 7 days = $126
- New weekly cost: $21/day * 7 days = $147

Finally, let's find the difference in the weekly electric bill:
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

So, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $21.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of chairs each person has.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ chairs} \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs each person has.

Ophelia has:
\[ 20 \text{ sofas} + 22 \text{ chairs} = 42 \text{ items} \]

Jenna has:
\[ 20 \text{ sofas} + 66 \text{ chairs} = 86 \text{ items} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:
\[ 42 \text{ items} + 86 \text{ items} = 128 \text{ items} \]

So, Ophelia and Jenna have 128 sofas and chairs.

Subtract the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of problems:
\[ \text{Remaining problems before Wednesday} = 100 - 48 = 52 \]

Next, calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Wednesday:
\[ \text{Problems completed on Wednesday} = \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

Subtract the problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems before Wednesday:
\[ \text{Remaining problems after Wednesday} = 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

answer:  Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick originally had \( 2G \) candies.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has now is \( G - 5 \). We are told that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick originally had:

\[ 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

1. For the first 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours each week:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For the next 2 weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. For the last 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, add up all the hours:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Josh has spent a total of 40 hours working out across the 8 weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine James's current age. Since James will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old James's cousin will be in 8 years. We know that in 8 years, James's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James's age. Therefore, in 8 years, James's cousin's age will be:

\[ 2 \times 22 - 5 = 44 - 5 = 39 \]

So, in 8 years, James's cousin will be 39 years old. To find James's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 39:

\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, James's cousin is currently 31 years old.

Finally, we calculate the age difference between James and his cousin:

\[ 31 - 22 = 9 \]

So, the age difference between James and his cousin now is 9 years.

\[ \boxed{9} \]

answer:  To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of raisins available for oatmeal cookies.
2. Calculate the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.
3. Divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed for one batch.

1. The total amount of raisins available is 27 cups.
2. One batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins.
3. To find the number of batches, we divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed for one batch:
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}}
   \]
   To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 27 \times 1.3333 = 36
   \]

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each boy brought 60 seashells:

\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seashells the girls brought. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Since four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:

\[ 4 \times 600 = 2400 \]

Adding this to the number of seashells brought by the boys:

\[ 600 + 2400 = 3000 \]

So, the girls brought a total of 3000 seashells. Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells by the number of girls:

\[ \frac{3000}{10} = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

answer:  To determine how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the dinner bill.
2. Determine the tip amount.
3. Add the tip to the total cost of the dinner bill.
4. Divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each person pays.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total cost of the dinner bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. To find the tip amount, we multiply $50 by 0.20:
   \[
   50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]
3. Add the tip to the total cost of the dinner bill:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60
   \]
4. Divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each person pays:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Therefore, you end up paying $30, including the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, determine Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we calculate:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

answer:  To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we first need to find the cost of the headphone set.

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a total of $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom hadn't bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 left to spend on CDs. Let's assume the cost of one CD is $4.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD:
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Cost of CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy an additional 11 CDs.

answer:  To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each of them and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 for each task.
- Jairus completed 20 tasks.
- Jairus's total earnings = $0.8/task * 20 tasks = $<<0.8*20=16>>16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 for each task.
- Jenny completed 20 tasks.
- Jenny's total earnings = $0.5/task * 20 tasks = $<<0.5*20=10>>10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's total earnings = $16
- Jenny's total earnings = $10
- Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's total earnings = $<<16-10=6>>6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more dollars than Jenny.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy initially received $6. He then added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

On the following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he spent $8 from his total:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he had $13 left. He then saved more money and was able to triple the amount he had left:

\[ 3 \times 13 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to the amount he had left:

\[ 13 + 39 = 52 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $52.

- Peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50

Now, add these amounts together to find the total cost:

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $<<4.50+4.00+4.50=13.00>>13.00

Verna gave $20, so we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

Change = $20 - $13.00 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

Therefore, Verna received $7.00 in change.

2. Determine the cost of the printer.
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and printer.
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and printer from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the monitors.
5. Divide the total cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

1. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
2. The cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount spent is $2,400, so the total cost of the monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. The cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \boxed{300} dollars.

answer:  To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \( 2 \times 31 = 62 \) mm thick.

Now, we add up the thicknesses of all four books:

\[ 31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm} \]

\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money they are dividing is $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

1. Five hamburgers at $4 each:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each:
   \[
   10 \times 0.30 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Carly pays with one fifty-dollar bill:
\[
50 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Carly gets $17 in change.

\[
\boxed{17}

answer:  To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her activities step by step.

1. **Writing the full alphabet twice:**
   - The full alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice means she writes \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet has \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing it once means she writes \( 13 \times 1 = 13 \) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written 52 full letters and 13 half-letters, which totals \( 52 + 13 = 65 \) letters.
   - Re-writing everything means she writes \( 65 \times 2 = 130 \) letters.

Now, we add up all the letters she has written:
\[ 52 + 13 + 130 = 195 \]

Elise has written a total of 195 letters.

answer:  To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to account for the weight loss over the 3 months he was unwell. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Mark's final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the total weight loss to his final weight:

\[ 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

answer:  Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125 for April. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.

First, let's determine how many days are in each half of April:
- April has 30 days.
- The first half of April has 15 days.
- The second half of April has 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

The total savings for April can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \( 2x = 50 \) each day in the second half of April.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator: 1 * $12 = $12
- One geometry set: 1 * $10 = $10

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

answer:  To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's daily earnings.
2. Calculate John's weekly earnings.
3. Determine how many weeks it will take to save $80.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings:
- John gets paid $2 per hour.
- He works 5 hours a day.
- Daily earnings = Hourly wage * Hours per day
- Daily earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Next, let's calculate John's weekly earnings:
- He works 4 days a week.
- Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * Days per week
- Weekly earnings = $10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take to save $80:
- Total savings = $80
- Weekly earnings = $40/week
- Number of weeks = Total savings / Weekly earnings
- Number of weeks = $80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

answer:  To calculate Antonella's commission for selling goods worth $2500, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the commission on the first $1000 of sales and the commission on the remaining $1500.

1. Commission on the first $1000:
   - Antonella earns a 30% commission on the first $1000 of sales.
   - Commission on $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. Commission on the remaining $1500:
   - Antonella earns a 10% commission on the remaining $1500 of sales.
   - Commission on $1500 = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

3. Total commission:
   - Total commission = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the remaining $1500
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission for selling goods worth $2500.

answer:  To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week.

First, let's calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day:
- Jeff's work is 3 miles away.
- He walks to work and back each day.
- Therefore, the total distance he walks in one day is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week:
- Jeff works 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total distance he walks in one week is:
  \[
  6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

answer:  When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Therefore, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we calculate the time for each scenario:

- On a cold day: \( 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes} \)
- On a hot day: \( 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time is:

\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer on a hot day than on a cold day.

answer:  To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Given:
- The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
- The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

First, calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} \]
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount, we calculate:

\[ \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{\text{Daily recommended amount}}{2} \]

Assuming the daily recommended amount is 4 cups, we have:

\[ \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate Juan's coffee intake. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan needs to reduce his intake, we subtract his current intake from the recommended amount:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 \text{ cups} - 4 \text{ cups} = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

answer:  To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters per cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ guinea pigs per cage} = 15 \text{ guinea pigs}
  \]

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
\[
30 \text{ hamsters} + 15 \text{ guinea pigs} = 45 \text{ rodents}
\]

The pet shop has 45 rodents in total.

answer:  To determine the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the size of Zack's locker.
2. Use the size of Zack's locker to find the size of Peter's locker.

First, let's find the size of Zack's locker:
- Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Therefore, the size of Zack's locker is:
  \[
  \text{Size of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
  \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker:
- Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker.
- Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is:
  \[
  \text{Size of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
  \]

Thus, the size of Peter's locker is:
\[
\boxed{3} \text{ cubic inches}

answer:  To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of toys Jonathan needs to make a play set five times larger than James's play set.
2. Calculate how many more toys Jonathan needs to reach this total.
3. Find out how many toys Jonathan currently has by subtracting the additional toys he needs from the total toys required.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Jonathan needs to make a play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so:

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

Next, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem, he needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys, so:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

answer:  To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles needed for each son.
2. Determine the total number of candles needed.
3. Calculate the number of packs required.
4. Find the total cost of the candles.

1. The older son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, he needs 8 candles.
3. The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.
4. Each pack contains 5 candles. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
   \]
5. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the answer is $12.

answer:  In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days, so she read a total of 15 minutes/day * 7 days = 105 minutes.
Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many pages she reads in 105 minutes.

First, calculate how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/interval = 70 intervals

Now, multiply the number of intervals by the number of pages she reads per interval:
70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks.

answer:  To determine the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the rate at which the sun is rising.

1. **Initial angle of the pyramid:**
   The pyramid sits at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of the sun rising:**
   The sun is rising at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Total angle the sun rises in 10 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total increase} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Total angle from the ground to the sun:**
   \[
   \text{Total angle} = \text{Initial angle} + \text{Total increase} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees.

answer:  To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has.
2. Calculate the total number of water bottles needed for the party.
3. Find the difference between the bottles needed and the bottles Bill currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has:
- Bill has 2 cases of water.
- Each case contains 24 bottles.
- Total bottles currently = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.

Next, let's calculate the total number of water bottles needed for the party:
- Bill has 70 guests.
- Each guest will have 2 bottles.
- Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.

Now, let's find the difference between the bottles needed and the bottles Bill currently has:
- Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Total bottles currently
- Additional bottles needed = 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to sum up the amounts received for each tooth she lost.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each:
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, she received half the amount of money she received for the first three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the first three teeth, she received $0.50 for each of the last two teeth:
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, Mark scored:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, Anna scored:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we sum up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

answer:  Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \).

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old} \]

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of buttons with two holes and the number of buttons with four holes.

The total number of buttons is 21, and 7 of them have two holes. Therefore, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

Each button with two holes contributes 2 holes, so:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes/button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Each button with four holes contributes 4 holes, so:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes/button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to find the total number of holes:
\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]

answer:  To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up all the individual expenses:

1. Spaying the kitten: $200
2. Vaccines: 3 vaccines * $20 each = $60
3. Broken vases: 4 vases * $12 each = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 + $60 + $48 = $308

So, the kitten has cost $308 so far.

answer:  Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Therefore, he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 per day * 3 days = $30 on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so he can buy $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he spends $10 per day * 4 days = $40 on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 6 wooden action figures + 20 plastic action figures = 26 action figures by the end of the week.

answer:  To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops per week.
3. Determine the difference between the number of roses grown and the number of roses ordered per week.
4. Multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a month (assuming 4 weeks for simplicity).

1. Ford grows 40 roses every week.
2. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.
3. The difference between the number of roses grown and the number of roses ordered per week is 65 - 40 = 25 roses.
4. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses Ford lacks per month is 25 * 4 = 100 roses.

answer:  To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine their individual weights.

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we find the average weight by dividing the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

answer:  To determine how much money Kate can make from selling her crayon muffins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small pieces of crayons Kate has.
2. Determine how many muffins she can make.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins.

First, let's find the total number of small pieces of crayons:
- Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each.
- Total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.

Next, we need to determine how many muffins she can make:
- Each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons.
- Number of muffins = Total crayons / Crayons per muffin = 192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins:
- Each muffin is sold for $1.50.
- Total revenue = Number of muffins * Price per muffin = 24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.

Therefore, Kate can make $36 from selling the muffins.

answer:  First, calculate the area of Michael's bedroom: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- New carpet cost: $12 per square foot * 216 square feet = $2592
- Padding cost: $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432
- Total cost for new carpet and padding: $2592 + $432 = $3024

Now, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet and installing the new carpet:
- Removal cost: $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864
- Installation cost: $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7344
- Total cost for removal and installation: $864 + $7344 = $8208

Finally, add the cost of the new carpet and padding to the cost of removal and installation:
- Total cost: $3024 + $8208 = $11232

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for 10 sandwiches:
- Bread cost: $3.00 per loaf * 10 loaves = $3.00 * 10 = $3.00
- Cheeses and condiments cost: $30.00 per 10 sandwiches = $30.00 / 10 = $30.00

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- Price per sandwich: $7.00
- Number of sandwiches sold: 10

Total revenue = $7.00 * 10 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00.

answer:  Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 64 dishes.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy is 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.
The total number of utensils brought by her friend is 40 cups + 64 dishes = 104 utensils.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is 36 + 104 = 140 utensils.

answer:  First, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference in temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

To find the percentage off, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4%.

Next, we need to find the actual temperature when the oven is set to 520 degrees. Using the same percentage off, we calculate:

\[ \text{Actual temperature} = 520 - \left( \frac{4}{100} \times 520 \right) = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees to achieve the correct temperature.

answer:  To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800
   \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price:
   \[
   \text{Juan's house price} = \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200
   \]

3. Calculate the total value of both houses combined:
   \[
   \text{Total value} = \text{Herb's house price} + \text{Juan's house price} = \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200
   \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200.

answer:  Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which is \( 0.99B \).

The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3.00B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3.00} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1495 = \boxed{5} \]

answer:  To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes in 2 years.
2. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Katina removes in 2 years:
- Katina removes $100 every month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, in 2 years, there are \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.
- The total amount removed in 2 years is \( 100 \times 24 = 2400 \) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
- The initial amount is $3000.
- The total amount removed is $2400.
- The remaining amount is \( 3000 - 2400 = 600 \) dollars.

Therefore, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account after 2 years.

answer:  First, calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts:
- Original price: $100.00
- Discount: 10% of $100.00 = $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00
- Discounted price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
- Total cost for 2 boxes: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Now, determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:
- Each box contains 90 contacts.
- Total contacts in 2 boxes: 90 * 2 = 180 contacts

Finally, calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
- Total cost for 2 boxes: $180.00
- Total contacts in 2 boxes: 180
- Cost per pair: $180.00 / 180 = $1.00

So, each pair of contacts will cost $1.00.

answer:  To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weight of each dog step by step.

1. **Affenpinscher:**
   - The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund:**
   - The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   - Therefore, the Dachshund's weight is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pounds.

3. **Papillon:**
   - The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   - Therefore, the Papillon's weight is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pounds.

4. **Mastiff:**
   - The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   - Therefore, the Mastiff's weight is \( 44 \times 5 = 220 \) pounds.

So, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]

answer:  First, calculate the total calories burned from each activity:

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Next, find the total calories burned from both activities:

- Total calories = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, determine how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink for every 200 calories burned:

- She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories.

Calculate the number of 200-calorie intervals in the total calories burned:

- Number of 200-calorie intervals = 1600 calories / 200 calories/interval = 8 intervals

Finally, calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:

- Total water needed = 8 intervals * 100 ml/interval = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

The answer is 800 ml.

answer:  To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the number of birds he saw each day:
- Day 1: 50 birds
- Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4: 120 birds
- Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 470 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:
Average birds = Total birds / Number of days
Average birds = 470 birds / 7 days
Average birds ≈ 67.14 birds per day

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is approximately 67.14 birds per day.

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2(J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

1. Identify the initial typing speed.
2. Identify the typing speed after the first increase.
3. Calculate the typing speed after the second increase.
4. Sum the three measurements.
5. Divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average.

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. Typing speed after the first increase: 52 WPM
3. Typing speed after the second increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

4. Sum the three measurements:
   \[
   47 \, \text{WPM} + 52 \, \text{WPM} + 57 \, \text{WPM} = 156 \, \text{WPM}
   \]

5. Divide the sum by the number of measurements:
   \[
   \frac{156 \, \text{WPM}}{3} = 52 \, \text{WPM}
   \]

So, the average of Jared's three measurements is 52 WPM.

answer:  To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the lengths of both movies into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the length of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 2 * 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of both movies together:

answer:  To find the total number of legs for all the pets in the store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - There are 5 dogs.
   - Total legs for dogs = 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.

2. **Cats:**
   - Each cat has 4 legs.
   - There are 2 cats.
   - Total legs for cats = 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.

3. **Birds:**
   - Each bird has 2 legs.
   - There are 10 birds.
   - Total legs for birds = 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Now, we add up the total number of legs for all the pets:
- Total legs = 20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs.

Therefore, the pets in the store have a total of \boxed{48} legs.

answer:  To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

**Amazon.com:**
- Cost of the boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4

Total cost on Amazon.com = Cost of the boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on Amazon.com = $16 + $4 = $20

**eBay:**
- Cost of the boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice as much as on Amazon.com, which is 2 * $4 = $8

Total cost on eBay = Cost of the boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

**Difference in cost:**
Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon.com
Difference in cost = $21 - $20 = $1

Therefore, the boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people invited via email:
- Alex invites 100 people via email.
- Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of people invited via email is:
  \[
  100 \times 2 = 200
  \]

Next, let's add the number of people invited by Alex's friends:
- Alex invites 10 friends.
- 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
- Therefore, the total number of people invited by her friends is:
  \[
  10 + 8 = 18
  \]

Now, let's add up all the attendees:
- People invited via email: 100
- People invited via friends: 200
- People invited by friends: 18

So, the total number of people attending the event is:
\[
100 + 200 + 18 = 318
\]

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday at $10 per hour: 1 hour * $10/hour = $10
- Total earnings for Jill: $20 + $10 = $30

Next, let's calculate John's earnings:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 hours = 4 hours.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.
- John worked 4 hours on Saturday at $10 per hour: 4 hours * $10/hour = $40
- John worked 3 hours on Sunday at $10 per hour: 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- Total earnings for John: $40 + $30 = $70

Now, find the difference in earnings between John and Jill:
- $70 - $30 = $40

answer:  To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake.

First, let's find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:
- A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 200 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams}
  \]

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake:
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the weekly protein intake is:
  \[
  6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams}
  \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week.

answer:  First, let's determine how much chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour. He can make 120 pounds in two hours, so in one hour, he makes:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate how much chocolate Marissa makes in one hour. She makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour, so she makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so together they make:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Over 12 hours, they will make:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

\[ 1260 \]

answer:  To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will lose: \( 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \)

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will gain: \( 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \)

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is 2.5 pounds.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

1. Each implant has a base price of $2000.
2. For one implant, George wants a crown, which costs an extra $500.
3. Therefore, the total cost for one implant with the crown is $2000 + $500 = $2500.
4. George needs 2 implants, so the total cost for the implants is 2 * $2500 = $5000.
5. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is $5000 - $600 = $4400.

Next, we need to determine how many hours George needs to work to earn $4400:

1. George makes $15 per hour.
2. To find the number of hours needed, we divide the total amount needed by his hourly wage: $4400 / $15 = 293 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 293 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has:

- Quarters: 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15

Adding these amounts together:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Colby has $3.45. Each gumball costs a nickel, which is $0.05. To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 / $0.05/gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The answer is 69 gumballs.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to track the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

1. **Day 1:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
2. **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles its height, so it is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
3. **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
4. **Day 4:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.
5. **Day 5:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) feet tall.
6. **Day 6:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(64 \times 2 = 128\) feet tall.

On Day 6, the beanstalk exceeds 20 feet, which is taller than Mark's window.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pumps of shampoo in the bottle. According to the directions, 2 pumps are used for 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of pumps is:

\[ 2 \text{ pumps} \times 120 \text{ washings} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per pump. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{$24.00}{240 \text{ pumps}} = $0.10 \text{ per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert $0.10 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ $0.10 \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, each pump will cost 10 cents.

answer:  To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new weight after a 50% increase from the original 8-pound weight.
2. Adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the increased weight since it was too heavy.

First, let's calculate the new weight after a 50% increase:

\[ \text{Original weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } 8 \text{ pounds} = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{New weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the new weight:

\[ \text{Final weight} = 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

answer:  To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to find the plane's speed in miles per hour.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Here, the distance is 2000 miles and the speed is 400 miles per hour. So, the time required is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

answer:  Let the smallest angle in the triangle be \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

\[
\boxed{90}

answer:  To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends over the three days and then subtract that from his original amount.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the amounts spent over the three days:
\[
8 \text{ (Monday)} + 16 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 64 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount he has left is:
\[
100 \text{ dollars} - 88 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left.

answer:  John received initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. His research took 10 times as long as the initial period, so it took 10 * 5 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, he spent $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 45 months, each month required 50% more funding than the initial $100,000. Therefore, each month required $100,000 + ($100,000 * 0.5) = $150,000.

So, for the remaining 45 months, he spent $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

In total, the cost of his research is $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

Therefore, the total cost of his research is $7,250,000.

answer:  First, let's determine how many rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a year.

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so in a year, he drives:
\[ 400 \text{ miles/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 4800 \text{ miles/year} \]

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per year is:
\[ 4800 \text{ miles/year} \times 725 \text{ rotations/mile} = 3440000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total rotations the tire can withstand by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10440000 \text{ rotations}}{3440000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 3 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after 3 years.

answer:  To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to add up the costs of each item she bought:

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each, so the cost for the rocks is \( 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \).
3. She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, so the cost for the coral is \( 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \).
4. She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, so the cost for the fish is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \).
5. The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, we add up all these costs:

\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00 \]

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

In the first year, he buys 1 game per month, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 10 + 12 + 5 = 27 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 27 + 24 + 5 = 56 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 56 + 48 + 5 = 109 games.

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has 109 games.

answer:  First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

\[ \text{Discounted price of the shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's add the cost of the pair of shorts. The price of the shorts is $35.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Now, let's determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. Joe has $50 initially.

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Joe will have $2.50 less than he started with after the purchase.

Therefore, Joe will have $2.50 less than he initially started with.

answer:  To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the total cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,860.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = $95,860 - $29,100 = $66,760.

Therefore, it costs $66,760 more to repave Lewis' street than to repave Monica's street.

answer:  To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection:
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections:
- There are 4 intersections.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights at all intersections is \( 24 \times 4 = 96 \).

Finally, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:
- There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
- Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is \( 96 - 20 = 76 \).

answer:  To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down his earnings into two parts: earnings from the first four hours and earnings from the next two hours.

1. **Earnings from the first four hours:**
   - Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
   - Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
   - Earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

2. **Earnings from the next two hours:**
   - Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
   - Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
   - Earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

3. **Total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

Therefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

answer:  To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used per week:
- Gary does laundry twice a week.
- Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- Therefore, the total water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Therefore, the total water used per year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the water used per year:
- Each gallon of water costs $0.15.
- Therefore, the total cost per year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

So, Gary spends **$312** on water for laundry in a year.

answer:  To find the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the amounts eaten by each player.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate 8 ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the meat consumed by the first three players:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

Total meat consumed by the first three players = 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

Since the fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is:
30 ounces (first three players) + 0 ounces (forth and fifth players) = 30 ounces

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of seats in the auditorium:
\[ 4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the number of administrator seats from the total number of seats:
\[ 72 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of parent seats from the remaining seats to find the number of student seats:
\[ 54 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 36 \text{ seats} \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen croissants.
2. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants.
3. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants (since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week).

1. The amount of butter needed for 1 dozen croissants is \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
2. The amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} \times 4 \text{ dozen} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]
3. The amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} \times 28 \text{ dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants.

answer:  To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to follow the growth pattern step by step.

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. Therefore, the height after the second week is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. Therefore, the height after the third week is:
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of cars towed in the first three days:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, determine the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days. Since the truck towed four fewer cars each day than the first three days, it towed:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to find the total number of cars towed in the week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]

answer:  Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. His school day lasts 8 hours, so he chews:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

After chewing 4 pieces at school, he has:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces left} \]

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

After chewing 2 more pieces, he has:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces left} \]

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, which is:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

After giving 7 pieces to his sister, he has:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces left} \]

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

answer:  To find the total number of posts made by the Reddit group in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in March.
2. Determine the total number of posts made by one member in March.
3. Calculate the total number of posts made by all members in March.

1. March has 31 days.
2. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Therefore, the total number of posts made by one member in March is:
   \[
   3 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93 \text{ posts/member}
   \]
3. The group has 1000 members. Therefore, the total number of posts made by all members in March is:
   \[
   93 \text{ posts/member} \times 1000 \text{ members} = 93,000 \text{ posts}
   \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000 posts.

answer:  To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each jewel and then sum them up.

1. The price of the diamond Jewell is given as $2000.
2. The price of the gold Jewell is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of the diamond Jewell. Therefore, the price of the gold Jewell is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
3. The cost of the silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of the gold Jewell. Therefore, the price of the silver Jewell is:
   \[
   1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum up the prices of all three jewels:
\[
2000 \text{ (diamond)} + 1600 \text{ (gold)} + 1200 \text{ (silver)} = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

answer:  To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the number of times each DVD can still be played and then sum these amounts.

1. **First DVD:**
   - The DVD can be played 1000 times in total.
   - It has already been played 356 times.
   - Therefore, the number of times it can still be played is:
     \[
     1000 - 356 = 644
     \]

2. **Second DVD:**
   - The DVD can be played 1000 times in total.
   - It has already been played 135 times.
   - Therefore, the number of times it can still be played is:
     \[
     1000 - 135 = 865
     \]

Now, we sum the number of times both DVDs can still be played:
\[
644 + 865 = 1509
\]

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times in total before they break.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.

So, the total amount of meat sold in one day is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat sold in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \text{ kg}}{150 \text{ kg/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

answer:  To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes (kb) per second to megabytes (Mb) per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

**Step 1: Convert kb per second to Mb per second**

We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb. Therefore, to convert 20 kb per second to Mb per second, we divide by 1000:

\[ 20 \text{ kb/second} \div 1000 = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb per second to Mb per hour**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, to convert Mb per second to Mb per hour, we multiply by 3600:

\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/hour.

answer:  To determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total cost for each coach and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the baseball coach:
- The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs.
- Each baseball costs $3.
- Total cost for the baseball coach = 9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $<<9*3=27>>27.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the basketball coach:
- The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs.
- Each basketball costs $14.
- Total cost for the basketball coach = 8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $<<8*14=112>>112.

Now, we find the difference in the total costs:
- Total cost for the basketball coach = $112
- Total cost for the baseball coach = $27
- Difference = $112 - $27 = $<<112-27=85>>85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

answer:  To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

1. Manny's total budget is $60.
2. The maximum cost per class is $10.

To find the maximum number of classes he can attend, we divide his total budget by the maximum cost per class:

\[ \text{Maximum number of classes} = \frac{\text{Total budget}}{\text{Maximum cost per class}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

So, Manny can attend up to 6 classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is the difference between the total number of classes and the maximum number of classes he can attend:

\[ \text{Number of classes to miss} = \text{Total number of classes} - \text{Maximum number of classes} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents don't sign him up again.

answer:  To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine the number of women who can stay upright.
3. Calculate the number of men who can stay upright.

First, let's find the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]

Finally, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

\[ V = 6 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 3 \text{ feet} \]

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \times 3 \text{ seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

1. Calculate the total number of sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent in physical therapy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.

1. John attended physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks:
   \[
   2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ sessions}
   \]

2. Each session is 2 hours long:
   \[
   12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. The cost per hour is $125:
   \[
   24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

answer:  To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   - Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   - Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
   - Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
   - Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   - Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
   - Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
   - Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10

Now, we sum up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps:
- Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
- Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
- Total number of stamps = 45

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.

answer:  To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the first website:
- The first website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the first website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the second website:
- The second website publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the second website = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
- Total articles by both websites = 560 articles (first website) + 280 articles (second website) = 840 articles.

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840.

The cost of 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50 \]

Finally, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total selling price of the 10 cars:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, let's determine how much the company paid to acquire the cars:
\[ 0.30 \times 250,000 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the profit made by the company:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on this profit:
\[ 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made $17,500.

answer:  To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily production for Julie.
2. Determine the daily production for both Julie and Jewel.
3. Calculate the weekly production by multiplying the daily production by the number of days in a week.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel, so Julie processes:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers daily}
   \]
3. The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is:
   \[
   50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers daily}
   \]
4. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is:
   \[
   150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers weekly}
   \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil and needs to dig 24 feet.

\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the speed of soil through clay, which is 2 feet per hour. He needs to dig 8 feet.

\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, add the time for digging through the soil and the time for digging through the clay to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for soil} + \text{Time for clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

answer:  James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750, so the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

He also buys 10 dress pants, and each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit, so each dress pant costs:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150 \]

The total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
dress shirts, and each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

The total cost for everything is:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

answer:  To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Let's calculate the cost of each feature:

- Leather seats: (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500
- Running boards: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, let's add all the costs together:

Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1500 = $43,500

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

answer:  To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them.

First, let's find the relative speed between Tom and Bob:
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap at a relative speed of 15 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

answer:  First, let's determine the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400 and this is half the total sales from green hats, we can calculate the total sales from green hats as follows:

\[ \text{Total sales from green hats} = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

Next, let's calculate the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, let's calculate the total amount she made in two months:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, Ariadne made $2100 in two months.

answer:  To find the total distance Alisa and Stanley biked, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Alisa = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
- Distance Alisa = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance Stanley = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
- Distance Stanley = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = Distance Alisa + Distance Stanley
- Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
- Total Distance = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

The final answer is 79 miles.

answer:  To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Paisley ran.
2. Calculate the distance Reggie ran.
3. Use the information that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn to find Lynn's distance.

Given:
- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
- Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

First, calculate the distance Reggie ran:
\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3 \]
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Lynn ran:

- She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \)
- She received a $2 discount: \( 400 - 2 = 398 \)

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid on Wednesday:
- She bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each: \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \)
- The store offered a 10% discount: \( 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \)
- The total cost after the discount: \( 600 - 60 = 540 \)

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
- Clara's final price: $398
- Sheila's final price: $540

The difference: \( 540 - 398 = 142 \)

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

answer:  First, let's calculate the 5% raise on Tim's $20,000 monthly salary:

\[ \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, he receives a bonus worth half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

His total monthly income including the bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find his annual income, we multiply his monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $372,000 in a year.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of each mixture.

For the first mixture:
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost for the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture:
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost for the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
- Difference = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, it costs $3 more for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than for the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

1. Howie buys 2 cupcakes for himself.
2. He buys 2 cupcakes for his teacher.
3. He buys 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates.

So, the total number of cupcakes is:
\[ 2 \text{ (for Howie)} + 2 \text{ (for the teacher)} + 2 \times 25 \text{ (for classmates)} \]

\[ 2 + 2 + 2 \times 25 = 2 + 2 + 50 = 54 \]

Since he decides to buy one of each flavor (vanilla and chocolate) for everyone, he needs to buy:
\[ 54 \text{ (vanilla)} + 54 \text{ (chocolate)} = 108 \text{ cupcakes} \]

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine how many whole eggs are required to make those deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the total number of whole eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves needed = 16 guests * 3 halves/guest = 48 halves.

Next, we find out how many whole eggs are required to make those deviled egg halves:
- Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
- Total whole eggs needed = 48 halves / 2 = 24 eggs.

Finally, we convert the total number of whole eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens needed = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

answer:  To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags.

First, let's find the total amount of flour in one bag:
- Each bag is divided into 8 portions.
- Each portion weighs 2 kilograms.

So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags:
\[ 16 \text{ kg/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

answer:  To determine how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.
2. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A.
3. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District C.
4. The remaining number will be the number of newspapers delivered to District B.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total newspapers delivered in a day: 600
2. Newspapers delivered to District A: 198
3. Newspapers delivered to District C: 209

First, subtract the newspapers delivered to District A from the total:
\[ 600 - 198 = 402 \]

Next, subtract the newspapers delivered to District C from the result:
\[ 402 - 209 = 193 \]

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

answer:  To determine the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to calculate the cooking time for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Rice**: It took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. **Pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, sum up the cooking times for all three items:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Finley a total of 120 minutes to cook all the food.

answer:  James hires the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15, and each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour. Therefore, the cost for each subsequent hour is $15 \times 2 = $30.

Let's calculate the total cost:
- The first hour costs $15.
- The second hour costs $30.
- The third hour costs $30.

Adding these together:
\[ 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \]

So, James paid $75.

1. Calculate the number of likes after one week.
2. Calculate the number of likes after three weeks.
3. Add the new likes received recently.

1. Initial number of likes: 2000

2. Number of likes after one week: 2000

3. Number of likes after three weeks: 70 times the initial number of likes
   \[
   \text{Number of likes after three weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

4. New likes received recently: 20000

5. Total number of likes: Initial likes + Likes after one week + Likes after three weeks + New likes
   \[
   \text{Total number of likes} = 2000 + 2000 + 140000 + 20000 = 164000
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 164000.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

1. Chips: 2 bags * $2.00/bag = $4.00
2. Fried chicken: $8.00
3. Soda: $1.00

Adding these together:
$4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00.

answer:  To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days it will take Mike to read the 200-page book.
2. Subtract this number from the 30-day deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish.

First, let's calculate the total number of days it will take Mike to read the 200-page book:

\[ \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of days it will take Mike to read the book from the 30-day deadline:

\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is:
\[ 7 \text{ candies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per candy} = \$3.50 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B is:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.75 \text{ per candy} = \$7.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$3.50 + \$7.50 = \$11.00 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he received is:
\[ \$15.00 - \$11.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, Adam received $4.00 in change.

answer:  First, determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Aurelia has $120 and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more dollars than Kassidy:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

Finally, divide the total amount of money equally among the three people:

\[ \text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120.

answer:  To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received into her bank account this week.
2. Subtract the amount received from her weekly wage to find out how much was withheld.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sally received into her bank account this week:

- At the start of the week, her bank account held $200.
- By the end of the week, her bank account holds $420.

The amount of money she received this week is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she received from her weekly wage:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of animal legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)
2. The total number of animal heads: \( S + G = 20 \)

First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Thus, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese.

answer:  James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so there are a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Each dog needs one toy, so James needs 12 toys for the 12 dogs.

After buying the toys, James goes back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 12 dogs when he left, twice as many more dogs is 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs.

So, the total number of dogs now is 12 + 24 = 36 dogs.

Each dog needs one toy, so James needs 36 toys for the 36 dogs.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs left is 36 - 3 = 33 dogs.

Each dog needs one toy, so James needs 33 toys for the 33 dogs.

In total, James needs 12 + 36 + 33 = 81 toys.

Therefore, James needs 81 toys in total.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class over 6 weeks:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, determine how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes.

answer:  To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to add the cost of the plane to the monthly maintenance costs.

1. Cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rent: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: Twice as much as the hanger rent, so 2 * $5,000 = $10,000

First, let's calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
Total monthly maintenance cost = Monthly hanger rent + Monthly fuel cost
Total monthly maintenance cost = $5,000 + $10,000
Total monthly maintenance cost = $15,000

Next, we add the cost of the plane to the total monthly maintenance cost:
Total annual cost = Cost of the plane + Total monthly maintenance cost * 12
Total annual cost = $150,000 + $15,000 * 12
Total annual cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

answer:  To find out how much candy each person would have after pooling and sharing equally, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of candy.
2. Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people.

First, let's find the total amount of candy:
- Robert has 3 pounds.
- Cindy has 5 pounds.
- Aaron has 4 pounds.

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds
Total candy = 12 pounds

Next, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people:
- There are 3 people (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron).

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 pounds / 3 people
Candy per person = 4 pounds

So, each person would have 4 pounds of candy.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

answer:  First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the height in feet by 12:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take the bamboo 12 days to reach a height of 600 inches.

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, which is 7 days.

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Roger buys a donut for $2.

\[ \text{Cost of donut} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is $44.

answer:  To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time spent in each mode and then sum them up.

1. **Time in turtle mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in turtle mode in 1 hour.
   - Since he mowed half of the lawn in turtle mode, the time spent in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time in rabbit mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode in 40 minutes.
   - Since he mowed half of the lawn in rabbit mode, the time spent in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time:**
   - Add the time spent in turtle mode and rabbit mode:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

answer:  First, determine the number of history teachers on the court. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of math teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers, so:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Now, calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so:

\[ \text{Total sleep time for math teachers} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

answer:  To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to account for all the good days and subtract them from the total number of days in the month.

First, let's count the total number of good days:
- The first eight days were good.
- The next eight days were good.
- The next three days were good, neutral, and good.

So, the total number of good days is:
\[ 8 + 8 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of days in the month:
- The first eight days were good.
- The second eight days were bad.
- The third eight days were neutral.
- The next three days were good, neutral, and good.

So, the total number of days in the month is:
\[ 8 + 8 + 8 + 3 = 27 \]

Now, we subtract the number of good days from the total number of days in the month:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 8 \]

answer:  Let's denote the age of one triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + 2(x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 7 + 2x + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 4x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 23 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 5.75 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 5.75 years. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

\[ 5.75 + 7 = 12.75 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is \boxed{12.75} years old.

answer:  Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

First, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, the new length of the dress after the extension is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Next, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. Therefore, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

First, subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

answer:  To determine Skyler's investment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Dylan's investment.
2. Determine the remaining amount after Dylan's investment.
3. Calculate Frances's investment.
4. Subtract Dylan's and Frances's investments from the total amount to find Skyler's investment.

First, let's calculate Dylan's investment:
\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

Next, we find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Then, we calculate Frances's investment:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

Finally, we subtract Dylan's and Frances's investments from the total amount to find Skyler's investment:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 1200 - 480 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler invested $240.

answer:  To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total dry ingredients for one muffin:
\[ 5 \text{ tablespoons} + 3 \text{ tablespoons} + 0.25 \text{ tablespoons} = 8.25 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Now, for 16 muffins:
\[ 8.25 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and John needs 2 vaccines:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, he will have:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25.

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Next, add the weight of Jack to the total weight of the 8 adults. Let's assume Jack weighs 80 kg for this calculation:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Now, compare the total weight to the maximum load of the elevator:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

answer:  To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deer.
2. Determine the number of bucks.
3. Calculate the number of 8-point bucks.

First, let's find the total number of deer:
\[ \text{Total number of deer} = 50 \]

Next, we calculate the number of bucks. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks:
\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

Finally, we determine the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8-point:
\[ \text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

answer:  To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal.
3. Calculate how many more signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks.

First, let's find the total number of signatures they currently have:
- Carol has 20 signatures.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures.
- Total current signatures = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Next, we determine how many more signatures they need to reach their goal:
- Their goal is 100 signatures.
- Additional signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Finally, we calculate how many more signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks:
- They have 3 weeks left.
- Signatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12 signatures per week.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 12 signatures each of the next three weeks to reach their goal.

answer:  To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already walked from the total time they have.

First, let's calculate the total time they have already walked:
- Time to get to the corner: 6 minutes
- Time to get to the fire station: 13 minutes

Total time walked so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Next, we subtract the time they have already walked from the total time they have:
- Total time available: 30 minutes
- Time walked so far: 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we add the number of regular chairs and the number of high chairs to find the total number of chairs currently available:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs currently available} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Finally, we determine the number of additional chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

answer:  To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to figure out how many pencils are currently in the box. 

Given:
- The box has space for 20 pencils.
- There are 4 pencils missing.

So, the number of pencils currently in the box is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cookies each person has based on the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}
   \]
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:
   \[
   73 + 23 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has to find the total:
\[
68 \text{ (Katarina)} + 73 \text{ (Max)} + 61 \text{ (Cookie Monster)} + 96 \text{ (Summer)} = 298 \text{ cookies}
\]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is \boxed{298}.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total time spent on homework = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, let's convert the total time John has before dinner into minutes:
- 3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
- Total time before dinner: 180 minutes
- Time spent on homework: 80 minutes

Time for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

answer:  To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all males.
4. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all females.
5. Add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to get the total number of dumplings cooked.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
3. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by all males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.
4. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by all females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.
5. The total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, let's calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her monthly car payment.

Now, let's subtract the amounts put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, after funding her retirement and paying for her car, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

answer:  To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2 per kilo = $4

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3 per kilo = $6

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

answer:  To determine the price of one crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \]

Therefore, the price for one crate of fruit is \boxed{32}.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
2. Subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck's capacity.

First, we know Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck can haul:
\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is:
\[ 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry:
\[ 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

The answer is 2800 pounds.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, let's find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes:
- Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
- 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.

So, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, we subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 68\% \]

Answer: 68%

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of one candy. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. The cost of five lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Therefore, the cost of four candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

To find the cost of one candy, we divide $1.20 by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Adding these together, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

answer:  First, let's determine the points collected by each student:

1. Adam collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam:
   \[
   50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   \[
   35 \times 3 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

answer:  To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total area of the comforter:
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is \( 68 \) square feet.

answer:  To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops she buys, she gets 3 scoops in total.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 3 scoops, the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00, we divide $6.00 by $4.50:
\[ \frac{6.00}{4.50} \approx 1.3333 \]

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 full set of 3 scoops. Therefore, she should buy:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream to get the maximum number of scoops possible under the deal with her $6.00.

answer:  To determine how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining amount of money needed.
2. Determine the amount raised per hour.
3. Calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount.

1. The remaining amount of money needed is:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]

2. The amount raised per hour is:
   \[
   \frac{2100}{3} = 700
   \]

3. The number of additional hours required to raise the remaining $4200 is:
   \[
   \frac{4200}{700} = 6
   \]

Since the firefighters have already fundraised for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal of $6300.

The answer is 9 hours.

Next, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah will see. Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks:

\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \text{ fireworks} \]

Now, let's add the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

\[ 3 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ fireworks per box} = 15 \text{ fireworks} \]

Finally, we add the fireworks she will see from the city display and the fireworks she will set off in her backyard:

\[ 120 \text{ fireworks} + 15 \text{ fireworks} = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

1. **Great Grandma Jones' Children:**
   - Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.

2. **Grandchildren:**
   - Each of the 3 children has 3 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).

3. **Great Grand-Babies:**
   - Each of the 9 grandchildren has 3 babies.
   - Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \).

Thus, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price of each computer.
2. Multiply the new price by the number of computers.

First, let's find the new price of each computer. The original price of each computer was $700, and the price increased by 10%.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we multiply the new price by the number of computers to find the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price is:

answer:  First, we need to determine how much money each person received based on the ratio 3:2.

The total ratio is \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Next, we divide $100 by 5 to find the value of one part:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we calculate Gerald's share:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Similarly, we calculate Julia's share:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his initial share:
\[ \text{Gerald's remaining money} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people in the group:
- Aiden
- 12 friends
- 7 more friends

Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Next, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks required for each person:
- Each person gets 2 drinks.
- Each person gets 3 snacks.

Total drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the drinks and snacks:
- Each drink costs $2.
- Each snack costs $2.

Total cost for drinks = 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Total cost for snacks = 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Finally, the total amount spent by the group on snacks and drinks is:
Total amount spent = Total cost for drinks + Total cost for snacks
Total amount spent = $80 + $120 = $200

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for James to pick the blueberries himself:

1. The cost to go picking is $20.
2. The cost per pound of blueberries is $1.5.
3. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost for picking = Cost to go picking + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
Total cost for picking = $65

Next, let's calculate the total cost for buying the blueberries at the store:

1. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
2. James buys 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
Total cost at the store = $75

Now, let's determine how much James saved:

Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
Savings = $75 - $65

James saved $10 by picking blueberries.

answer:  To determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sacks of rice given to her cousin and brother.
2. Determine the total weight of the rice in those sacks.

First, let's find the total number of sacks given to her cousin and brother:
- Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- Goldy gave 4 sacks to her brother.

So, the total number of sacks given is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we know that each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice. Therefore, the total weight of the rice in the 7 sacks is:
\[ 7 \times 25 = 175 \text{ kilograms} \]

Thus, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

answer:  To determine how many people accept the position, we need to follow the steps of the hiring process:

1. **Calculate the number of people who receive interviews:**
   - 100 people apply for the job.
   - 30% of those who apply receive interviews.
   - Number of people who receive interviews = \( 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the number of people who receive a job offer:**
   - 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer.
   - Number of people who receive a job offer = \( 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \).

3. **Calculate the number of people who accept the position:**
   - A third of those who receive a job offer accept the position.
   - Number of people who accept the position = \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \).

Therefore, 2 people accept the position.

answer:  The restaurant initially has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. So, the total number of chairs initially is:

\[ 170 + 23 = 193 \]

If 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs are sent to the carpenter for repair, the number of normal chairs left is:

\[ 170 - 20 = 150 \]

The number of baby chairs left is:

\[ 23 - 13 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs left is:

\[ 150 + 10 = 160 \]

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

answer:  First, determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substitute the turtle's speed and the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks.

Ginger's remaining candy:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy's remaining candy:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256 windows.

Next, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Now, let's determine how many windows Hannah smashes:

- Windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * 256 = 64 windows.

- She smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of windows smashed:

answer:  To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each ingredient and then sum them up.

1. **Calories from eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. **Calories from cheese:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Calories from ham:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of ham.
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, sum up the calories from all the ingredients:
- Total calories = 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories

answer:  To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the total cost of fixing the pothole to the potential damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
- The fine for fixing the pothole is $120.
- The cost of the asphalt is 3 buckets × $25/bucket = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:
\[ $120 + $75 = $195 \]

Next, let's calculate the potential damage to the car if the pothole doesn't get fixed:
- The damage to the car is $450.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to the car:
\[ $450 - $195 = $255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

answer:  First, let's determine the rate at which the factory produces each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Next, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 2.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 150 quarts.

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 150 quarts (vanilla) = 2550 quarts.

answer:  To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

1. Calculate the number of smores for the kids:
   \[
   9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of smores for the adults:
   \[
   6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of smores needed:
   \[
   18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
   \]

4. Determine how many boxes are needed, given that each box contains 3 sleeves:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Therefore, they will need 8 boxes of graham crackers.

answer:  To determine how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week.
2. Identify the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought last week.
3. Subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week:
- She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch.
- She bought 5 boxes of Fruit Loops.

So, the total number of boxes bought this week is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we know that last week she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

answer:  First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes from inches to inches. Topher's shoes are 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( B \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. We can set up the equation:

\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

To find \( B \), we first subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]
\[ 90 = 9B \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

answer:  To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom.
2. Multiply the calculated area by the number of tiles needed per square foot.

First, let's find two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot. Therefore, the total number of tiles needed is:
\[ 24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

answer:  First, calculate the number of votes candidate A received:

Next, calculate the number of votes candidate B received:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, calculate the total number of votes for candidates A and B:
\[ \text{Total votes for A and B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Finally, calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes.

answer:  Each pizza has 12 slices, so 5 pizzas have a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which means each of them ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. Therefore, the three of them ate 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which means each of them ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices. Therefore, the two of them ate 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Each pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers:
\[ 8 \text{ erasers} \times \$0.25 \text{ per eraser} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add the total cost of the pencils and erasers:
\[ \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00 \]

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
\[ \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00 \]

So, you would get \$5.00 in change.

Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars, so she spent 10 * $5 = $50 on gallon jars.
She also bought 16 half-gallon jars, so she spent 16 * $3 = $48 on half-gallon jars.
The total amount of money she spent is $50 + $48 = $98.

Now, we calculate the percentage of blue spools:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

1. Math book: 2 pounds
2. Science book: 2 pounds
3. French book: 4 pounds
4. English book: 3 pounds
5. History book: Twice as much as the English book

First, calculate the weight of the history book:
\[ \text{History book} = 2 \times \text{English book} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add up the weights of all the books:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Math book} + \text{Science book} + \text{French book} + \text{English book} + \text{History book} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with her arms at her sides for 5 minutes.

- Right foot: 300 taps/minute × 5 minutes = 1500 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute × 5 minutes = 1250 taps

Total taps with arms at sides: 1500 + 1250 = 2750 taps

Next, let's calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

- Right foot: 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps

Total taps with arms raised: 400 + 400 = 800 taps

Finally, let's add the taps from both scenarios to find the combined total number of taps.

Total taps: 2750 taps (arms at sides) + 800 taps (arms raised) = 3550 taps

answer:  To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to determine the ages of each person and then sum them up.

1. **Dora's age:**
   Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Dora's father's age:**
   Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Dora's mother's age:**
   Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
   \]

4. **Total combined age:**
   Add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.
   \[
   \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
   \]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of slices**: Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on her plate.

2. **Adding more slices**: She adds 3 more slices to the plate.
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Tripling the slices**: She then triples the number of slices she has.
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Eating some slices**: She eats 2 slices.
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Stolen slices**: Her friend steals 5 slices from the plate.
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

answer:  To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many books Steven has.
2. Determine how many books Alice has.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.

\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.

\[ A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we calculate the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

**Answer:** Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

answer:  To find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat.

So, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:
\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the total time taken by both the cat and the dog:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time is 25 minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine how many apples Beck has. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, the new number of apples Beck has is:

\[ \text{Beck's new apples} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, let's find out how many apples Boris has after giving away 10 apples:

\[ \text{Boris's new apples} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now:

\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

answer:  First, determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students is 80 and there are two classes, each class has:

\[ \text{Number of students per class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, calculate the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls per class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

Now, find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of boys per class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

answer:  First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:

- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The old vendor sells each tomato for $0.50.
- Daily cost from the old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.50/tomato = $250.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:

- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The new vendor sells each tomato for $0.40.
- Daily cost from the new vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.40/tomato = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings:

- Daily savings = Daily cost from the old vendor - Daily cost from the new vendor
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly savings:

- Weekly savings = Daily savings * Number of days in a week
- Weekly savings = $50/day * 7 days/week = $350/week.

- Cost for 2 children: 2 * $12 = $<<2*12=24>>24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:

- Cost for 2 adults: 2 * $14 = $<<2*14=28>>28
- Cost for 2 children: 2 * $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:

- Savings: $76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \).

According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students in the class is 50. We know that 10 students like to bake, 5 students like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to either play video games or play music is:
\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, we can set up the following equation:
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

answer:  To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we add up all the matches:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

Total matches = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches

Therefore, Joey played 7 matches in one week.

answer:  First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one week:

- Weekdays:
  - 5 weekdays * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs

- Weekends:
  - 2 weekends * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs

Total chairs rented in one week:
- 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:

- 4 weeks * 500 chairs/week = 2000 chairs

Finally, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:

- 2 months * 2000 chairs/month = 4000 chairs

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.

answer:  To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she needs to groom and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the total number of animals:
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12

   Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

2. Determine the number of days in a week:
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. Divide the total number of animals by the number of days:
   Animals per day = Total animals / Number of days
   Animals per day = 28 / 7

4. Perform the division:
   28 / 7 ≈ 4.1428

Since Melissa can't groom a fraction of an animal, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.

Rounding 4.1428 to the nearest whole number gives us 4.

Therefore, Melissa will groom approximately 4 animals each day of the week.

answer:  Peter starts with 32 ounces of water.
He makes 3 giant cubes, each using 4 ounces, so he uses 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 ounces for the giant cubes.
He makes 7 medium cubes, each using 2 ounces, so he uses 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 ounces for the medium cubes.
He makes 8 small cubes, each using 1/2 ounce, so he uses 8 * 1/2 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 ounces for the small cubes.
In total, Peter uses 12 + 14 + 4 = <<12+14+4=30>>30 ounces of water.
He started with 32 ounces and used 30 ounces, so he has 32 - 30 = <<32-30=2>>2 ounces of water left.

answer:  To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs in one playlist.
2. Determine the total number of songs in 20 playlists.
3. Calculate the total duration of all the songs in 20 playlists.

1. The number of songs in one playlist is 300.
2. John has 20 such playlists, so the total number of songs in 20 playlists is:
   \[
   300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs}
   \]
3. Each song is 10 hours long, so the total duration of all the songs in 20 playlists is:
   \[
   6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60,000 hours.

The answer is 60,000 hours.

1. Identify the number of marbles Sean has.
2. Calculate the number of marbles Carl has.
3. Calculate the number of marbles Cal has.
4. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.

Given:
- Sean has 56 marbles.
- Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.

First, calculate the number of marbles Carl has:
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, calculate the number of marbles Cal has:
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Finally, add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together:
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, so she trades 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, so she trades 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
Each large sticker is worth one large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.
Each large button is worth three small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons, so she trades 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.
Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
In total, Lorraine has 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed by the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles, and the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs \( x \) cases of shingles, the third house also needs 100 cases of shingles.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

answer:  To find the price after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \right) \times \text{Original Price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \left( \frac{5}{100} \right) \times 140
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 0.05 \times 140
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 7
   \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 133
   \]

So, you will pay $133.

answer:  To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly electricity bill.
2. Divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates to find the monthly cost per roommate.
3. Multiply the monthly cost per roommate by 12 to find the annual cost per roommate.

First, let's calculate the total monthly electricity bill:
\[ \text{Total monthly bill} = \$100 \]

Next, we divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates to find the monthly cost per roommate:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{\$100}{4} = \$25 \]

Finally, we multiply the monthly cost per roommate by 12 to find the annual cost per roommate:
\[ \text{Annual cost per roommate} = \$25 \times 12 = \$300 \]

Therefore, each roommate will pay \$300 per year for electricity.

answer:  Mark buys 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

He gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

He also gets 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

The total value of all the cards is:
\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the packs from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, Mark's profit is:
\[ 1100 \]

Therefore, Mark's profit is $1100.

answer:  Jayden initially has $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90/2 = $45.

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more to buy the camera.

answer:  To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total kilograms of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Determine the total cost of the oranges.

First, let's find out how many kilograms of oranges are needed for 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice, for 4 liters, he would need:

\[ 5 \text{ kg/liter} \times 4 \text{ liters} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms is:

\[ 20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

answer:  Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which is \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students to be separated into 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

So, each group has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups. Since each group has 9 students, we multiply 12 by 9:

\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

So, we need 108 students for 12 groups.

We currently have 54 students. To find out how many more students are needed, we subtract the number of students we have from the total number required:

\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

Therefore, we need 54 more students. Since each group has 9 students, we divide 54 by 9 to find out how many more groups are needed:

\[ 54 \div 9 = 6 \]

So, we need 6 more groups.

answer:  To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
2. Subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make.
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3 \text{ per eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, we subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Finally, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears of corn}} = \$3 \text{ per ear} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

answer:  To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marissa had initially.
2. Subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount to find out how much money she has left.
3. Divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars she bought.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Marissa initially had $80.
2. The cost of the ball is $20. So, we subtract $20 from $80:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball.
3. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, we divide $60 by $5:
   \[
   60 \div 5 = 12
   \]
   Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

Therefore, the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy is 12.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, calculate the number of people remaining after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 people remain.

Then, calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]
So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]
So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

The final answer is \( \boxed{16} \).

answer:  To determine how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles and then subtract that from the total number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:

Now, let's add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels used from the total number of wheels in the box:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

answer:  To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold.
2. Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of vanilla and fruity scents sold.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- There are 4 vanilla scents.
- Each vanilla scent is sold 5 times.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 4 vanilla scents * 5 sales per vanilla scent = 20 vanilla scents.

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- There are 8 fruity scents.
- Each fruity scent is sold 2 times.
- Total fruity scents sold = 8 fruity scents * 2 sales per fruity scent = 16 fruity scents.

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla and fruity scents sold:
- Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

answer:  To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.
2. Subtract the number of broken glasses and plates from the initial total.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses.
- 1 dozen = 12 glasses
- Therefore, 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses

- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates.
- 1 dozen = 12 plates
- Therefore, 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we subtract the number of broken glasses and plates from the initial total:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

- Remaining glasses: 96 glasses - 10 glasses = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 plates - 6 plates = 42 plates

Therefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

The final answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the ingredients for the salad, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cucumbers:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - Each cucumber costs $2.
   - Total cost for cucumbers = 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

2. **Tomatoes:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes = 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

3. **Lettuce:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce = 1 head of lettuce * $3/head of lettuce = $3

Now, we add up the total costs of all the items:
- Total cost for cucumbers = $6
- Total cost for tomatoes = $5
- Total cost for lettuce = $3

Total cost = $6 + $5 + $3 = $14

Therefore, together, they spent $14 to make the salad for the potluck.

1. **Distance driven:**
   - Driving speed: 50 miles per hour
   - Driving time: 6 hours
   - Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles per hour × 6 hours = 300 miles

2. **Distance hiked:**
   - Hiking speed: 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed
   - Half the driving speed: 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour
   - Hiking speed: 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour
   - Hiking time: 1.5 hours
   - Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

3. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles

The vacation spot is 330 miles.

answer:  To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students for each size and then sum them up.

1. **Size extra-small**: 11 students
2. **Size small**: Twice as many students as size extra-small
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ students}
   \]
3. **Size medium**: Four less than the number of size small students
   \[
   22 - 4 = 18 \text{ students}
   \]
4. **Size large**: Half as many students as size medium
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ students}
   \]
5. **Size extra-large**: Six more students than size large
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15 \text{ students}
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of students for each size:
\[
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts.

answer:  To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to consider both the time he spends driving there and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum:
- Distance to the museum: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Next, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving back home:
- Distance back home: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time Jack spends driving:
- Total driving time = Time to the museum + Time back home = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Finally, let's add the time Jack spends at the museum:
- Time at the museum: 6 hours
- Total time gone = Total driving time + Time at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours.

answer:  To determine the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books read by Ahmed.
2. Calculate the total number of books read by Ezra.
3. Add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can calculate the number of books read by Ahmed as follows:
\[ \text{Number of books read by Ahmed} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we know that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books read by Ezra is:
\[ \text{Total number of books read by Ezra} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed:
\[ \text{Total number of books read} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed is \(\boxed{600}\).

answer:  Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{9}\), which is \(\frac{9}{2}\):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 6 \times 4.5 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

answer:  To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum the costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches.
   - Cost per pound: $2.00
   - Total cost for peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00

2. **Plums:**
   - Winston picked 8 pounds of plums.
   - Cost per pound: $1.00
   - Total cost for plums: 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

3. **Apricots:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of apricots.
   - Cost per pound: $3.00
   - Total cost for apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we sum the costs for all the fruits:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

#### $38.00.

answer:  Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday + 5 hours on Sunday = 12 hours over the weekend.
She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours left.
She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours.
Therefore, she spends 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours playing soccer.
To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

answer:  Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( x \).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish he has is:
\[ 3 + 4 + 17 = 24 \]

Let \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Since the total number of fish bought is 17, and 3 of them are orange, the number of orange fish bought is:
\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

Substituting \( y = 14 \) into the equation:
\[ 3 + 14 = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 17 = 8 + 2x \]
\[ 2x = 9 \]
\[ x = 4.5 \]

So, Bob bought 4.5 white fish.

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has.

George has 45% more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 45\% \text{ of Number of bananas} \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 290 \]

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 \]

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 490 \]

George has 490 fruits.

answer:  To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the 5 days they ride 3 times a day and the 2 days they ride twice the usual amount.

1. Calculate the number of rides for the 5 days they ride 3 times a day:
   \[
   5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 15 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of rides for the 2 days they ride twice the usual amount:
   \[
   2 \text{ days} \times (3 \text{ rides/day} \times 2) = 2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ rides/day} = 12 \text{ rides}
   \]

3. Add the rides from both periods together:
   \[
   15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
   \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times a week.

answer:  To calculate the price you have to pay after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000, follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 200 \]

Next, subtract the discount amount from the original price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.

1. **Number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

2. **Number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \)

3. **Number of OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the sales are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - 15
   - Number of OLED TVs = 25

Therefore, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

 Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

answer:  On Monday:
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns $15 * 5 = $75.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday:
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns $15 * 2 = $30.
- Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes, she does not earn an additional $5 per day.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Total earnings for the two days = $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   The train starts with 172 people.

2. **First stop:**
   - 47 people get off the train.
   - 13 people get on the train.

   First, subtract the number of people who get off:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]

   Then, add the number of people who get on:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]

   So, after the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.

3. **Second stop:**
   - 38 people get off the train.

   Subtract the number of people who get off:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

   So, after the second stop, there are 100 people on the train.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

answer:  Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \), the number of berries she collects as \( B \), and the number of seconds left on the timer as \( T \).

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies, collects \( B + 3 \) berries, and finishes the level \( T - 4 \) seconds slower.

Emma's score is calculated as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Ava's score is calculated as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T + 35 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ 35 \text{ points} \]

answer:  To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon.
2. Determine the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Brandon.
3. Calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie.
4. Determine the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Charlie.

1. Anthony gave half of his pencils to Brandon:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. The number of pencils remaining after giving some to Brandon is:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils}
   \]

3. Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \text{ pencils}
   \]

4. The number of pencils remaining after giving some to Charlie is:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils}
   \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many 9-person groups were formed from the 90 people.

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members who brought back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members who brought back 2 seashells each.

\[
\text{Number of groups with 2 seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group has 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells.

\[
\text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Since there are 6 such groups:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108
\]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 108.

answer:  To determine how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the amount of money Mike has.

First, let's calculate the discount amount. The original price of the jeans is $40, and the discount is 25% off.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 25\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.

\[ \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Finally, we subtract the sale price from the amount of money Mike has. Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

answer:  To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week.
2. Determine the total gallons of gas consumed in a week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gas consumed in a week.

1. **Total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy drives to work 5 days a week.
   - The one-way distance is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance in a week = 5 miles/day * 5 days/week = 25 miles/week.

2. **Total gallons of gas consumed in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG.
   - Total gallons consumed in a week = 25 miles/week / 10 MPG = 2.5 gallons/week.

3. **Total cost of the gas consumed in a week:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.
   - Total cost in a week = 2.5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $7.50/week.

1. The number of female lions is 12.
2. The number of male lions is half as many as the female lions. Therefore, the number of male lions is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \).
3. The number of lion cubs is 14.

Adding these together, the total number of lions is:
\[ 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure.

answer:  Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in various series, so he has 600/3 = 200 series movies.
The cost of each series movie is $6 off the cost of a normal movie, so each series movie costs $10 - $6 = $4.
The total cost for the series movies is 200 * $4 = $800.
The remaining movies are older movies, so he has 600 - 200 = 400 older movies.
40% of these movies are older movies, so he has 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.
Each older movie costs $5, so the total cost for the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.
The total cost for replacing all the movies is $800 + $800 = $1600.

answer:  To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and the total cost of 2 bagels, then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \( 3 \times 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \( 2 \times 1 = $<<2*1=2>>2 \).

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and the cost of 2 bagels:
- Cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6
- Cost of 2 bagels: $2
- Difference: \( 6 - 2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 \).

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

- Billy's total earnings: $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.00
- Sally's total earnings: $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.00

Therefore, Billy will earn $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00 more than Sally.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost $30:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs $2.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, she plays \( 0.5 \times 7 = 3.5 \) hours.
- For 2 weeks, she plays \( 3.5 \times 2 = 7 \) hours.

For the next week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, she plays \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she has played:
- Total hours played so far: \( 7 + 14 = 21 \) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement.
- Therefore, she still needs to play \( 30 - 21 = 9 \) hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The answer is 9 hours.

answer:  To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of the bottle caps in a 30-day month.

First, let's calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total number of bottle caps he finds in a 30-day month is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of these bottle caps:
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

So, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

answer:  To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals.

She wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of her total stuffed animals. Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she buys.

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) stuffed goats will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

She wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total number of square inches by the height of the mosaic:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long if he has two bags of glass chips.

answer:  To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months.

1. **Number of employees after three months:**
   - Initial employees: 200
   - Employees added per month: 20
   - Total employees after three months: 200 + (20 * 3) = 200 + 60 = 260

2. **Total monthly salary for all employees:**
   - Salary per employee: $4000
   - Total monthly salary: 260 * $4000 = $1040,000

3. **Total amount paid over three months:**
   - Total amount paid: $1040,000 * 3 = $3120,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$3,120,000**.

answer:  To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the percentage of students who passed in each grade and then find the average of these percentages.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Pass rate = 2 * 40% = 80%

Now, we find the average of these pass rates:
- Average pass rate = (68% + 40% + 80%) / 3
- Average pass rate = 188% / 3
- Average pass rate = 62.67%

The school's overall pass rate is approximately 62.67%.

answer:  To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature difference between the day and night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it is 33 degrees colder at night. Therefore, the temperature at night is:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Carson needs to keep the temperature inside the house above 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, he needs to increase the temperature by:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase required by the temperature increase each log provides:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing in the house during the night.

answer:  To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Pierson's points.
2. Calculate Nikita's points based on the given relationship.
3. Add Pierson's and Nikita's points together.

1. Pierson scored 278 points.
2. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. First, find half of Pierson's points:
   \[
   \text{Half of Pierson's points} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
   \]
   Then, add 11 to this amount to find Nikita's points:
   \[
   \text{Nikita's points} = 139 + 11 = 150
   \]
3. Now, add Pierson's and Nikita's points together:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 278 + 150 = 428
   \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428. #### 428

answer:  To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, let's find the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week. He made $105, and each branch costs $0.25.

\[
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[
\frac{420}{7} \approx 60.00
\]

So, on average, Felix climbed approximately 60.00 branches per day during the week.

answer:  To determine how many additional students have joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **January**: 10 students
2. **February**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **March**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **April**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **May**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students

So, by the end of May, there are 160 students on campus.

To find out how many additional students have joined, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (160):

\[ 160 - 10 = 150 \]

Therefore, 150 additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

answer:  To determine how much Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her regular hours and her overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Earnings from regular hours = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 overtime hours.
   - Her overtime hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour
   - Earnings from overtime hours = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
   - Total earnings = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on Tuesday.

answer:  To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
- Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance of the first car = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
- Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance of the second car = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Distance difference = Distance of the second car - Distance of the first car
- Distance difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the distance separating the two cars is:
#### 20 miles.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of salt Tanya uses as \( S \) ounces. According to the problem, she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so the amount of sugar is also \( S \) ounces.

Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2S \) ounces.

She also uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of zest is \( \frac{S}{2} \) ounces.

The total volume of the jar is the sum of all the ingredients:
\[ S + S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = 10 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 5S + \frac{S}{2} = 10 \]
\[ \frac{10S}{2} = 10 \]
\[ 5S = 10 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, Tanya uses 2 ounces of salt. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2S = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

answer:  To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for each song and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the time for "Deck the Halls":
   - "Deck the Halls" is 150 seconds long.
   - The choir plans to sing it twice.
   - Total time for "Deck the Halls" = 150 seconds/song * 2 songs = 300 seconds.

2. Calculate the time for "Jingle Bells":
   - "Jingle Bells" is 240 seconds long.
   - The choir plans to sing it once.
   - Total time for "Jingle Bells" = 240 seconds/song * 1 song = 240 seconds.

3. Add the total times for both songs:
   - Total caroling time = Total time for "Deck the Halls" + Total time for "Jingle Bells"
   - Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will carol for a total of 540 seconds.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts: \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) quarts
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) quarts

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount from quarts to gallons:
\[ 48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts per gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

answer:  First, let's determine how long each person can play with 1 quarter:

- Jack: 1 quarter for 20 minutes
- Two friends: 1 quarter for 10 minutes (since they play half as long as Jack)
- One friend: 1 quarter for 30 minutes (since he plays 1.5 times as long as Jack)

Next, we calculate the total number of minutes played in 4 hours:

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we determine how many 10-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:

240 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 24 intervals

Since each interval requires 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:

24 intervals * 1 quarter/interval = 24 quarters

Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount of money used is:

24 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $6

Therefore, the total amount of money used is $6.

answer:  To determine how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money raised by the students.
2. Divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

First, let's find the total amount raised by the students:

Total amount raised by the charity: $175,000
Amount raised by organizations: $50,000

Total amount raised by the students = Total amount raised by the charity - Amount raised by organizations
Total amount raised by the students = $175,000 - $50,000
Total amount raised by the students = $125,000

Next, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Number of students = 20

Amount raised by each student = Total amount raised by the students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised \boxed{6,250}.

Number of students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Total students = 25 students/class * 40 classes = 1000 students.

Number of teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Total teachers = 3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers.

Next, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by students and teachers.

Trees planted by students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Total trees by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.

Trees planted by teachers:
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- Total trees by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Total trees planted = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, after selling and giving away some of his cars, Joe remains with:

\[ 16 \text{ cars} \]

The answer is 16 cars.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picked:

1. 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Adding these together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, let's account for the fact that Rose dropped 1 flower from each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Adding these up:
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Subtracting these from the total petals:
101 - 22 = 79 petals

answer:  To determine the total amount James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold.
2. Add the 30% premium to the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold:
- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300
- Total cost of the diamond and gold: \( 600 + 300 = 900 \)

Next, we need to add the 30% premium to the total cost:
- Premium: 30% of $900
- Premium: \( 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \)

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold:
- Total cost of the diamond and gold: $900
- Premium: $270
- Total amount paid: \( 900 + 270 = 1170 \)

Therefore, James paid a total of $1170 for the ring.

answer:  First, determine how many tasks John completes in one day:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is:
  \[
  30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
  \]

Next, calculate how much John earns per day:
- Each task pays $1.20.
- Therefore, the earnings per day are:
  \[
  150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$180 \text{ per day}
  \]

Finally, calculate John's weekly earnings:
- John works 7 days a week.
- Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
  \[
  \$180 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260 \text{ per week}
  \]

John makes $1,260 if he works a full 7-day week.

answer:  To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the goats:**
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

2. **Cost of the cows:**
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for goats = $1500
   - Total cost for cows = $3000
   - Total amount spent = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Therefore, John spent $4500.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total shipping cost:

1. Weight of the book: 4 pounds
2. Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
3. Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
4. Shipping cost per mile: $0.08

Total shipping cost = (4 pounds * $0.35/pound) + (20 miles * $0.08/mile)
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Total shipping cost = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund from Amazon:

1. Purchase price of the book: $32
2. Refund percentage: 75%

Refund amount = 75% of $32
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the net loss:

Net loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Net loss = $3.00 - $24.00
Net loss = -$21.00

Therefore, Milly will lose $21.00.

answer:  To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of egg and then sum them up.

1. **Green eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we add up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs.

\boxed{27}

answer:  First, let's determine the time Sandy walked on the second day. Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked for 8 hours on the first day, she walked:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent walking on both days to find the total time:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]

The answer is 720 minutes.

answer:  To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of butterscotch candies Dale ordered.
2. Subtract the number of candies he sold.
3. Add the number of candies he ordered later.

Let's go through the calculations:

1. Initial number of butterscotch candies: 100
2. Number of candies sold: 150
3. Number of candies ordered later: 100

First, subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number:
\[ 100 - 150 = -50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Dale has already sold all the candies he initially ordered and has 50 candies left.

Next, add the number of candies ordered later:
\[ -50 + 100 = 50 \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

Therefore, the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs, which is 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes each week.
She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup, which is 15 * 6 = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes each week.
In total, Britany spends 72 + 120 + 90 = <<72+120+90=282>>282 minutes each week on TikTok.
In a month with four weeks, she spends 282 * 4 = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes on TikTok.
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60, so she spends 1128 / 60 = <<1128/60=18>>18 hours on TikTok in a month.

answer:  The base installation cost is $129.00, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela has:
- Mirrors: 6
- Chandeliers: 2
- Pictures: 20

Total additional items = 6 + 2 + 20 = 28 items

Next, we calculate the cost for the additional items. The cost per additional item is $15.00.

Cost for additional items = 28 items * $15.00 per item = $420.00

Finally, we add the cost of the additional items to the base installation cost to find the total cost:

Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost for additional items
Total cost = $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $549.00.

answer:  To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food:
- Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
- Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than tins of dog food.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean:
- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Next, let's account for the marshmallows dropped on the ground:
- They dropped 3 marshmallows.
- Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:
- The bag originally had 35 marshmallows.
- Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Finally, let's determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows:
- Each kid can have 14 marshmallows / 2 kids = 7 S'mores.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left.

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both segments to find the total distance:

Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

answer:  Mulan starts with $40. Her father gave her $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtract the total amount spent from her initial amount:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

answer:  First, let's determine the speed of one kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, the speed of one kangaroo is:

\[ \text{Speed of one kangaroo} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ kangaroos}} = 6 \text{ hours per turtle} \]

Next, we need to find the speed of one turtle. Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is:

\[ \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{6 \text{ hours per turtle}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours per turtle} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to travel across the highway. Since each turtle takes 3 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles will take:

\[ \text{Time for four turtles} = 4 \text{ turtles} \times 3 \text{ hours per turtle} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles \boxed{12} hours to travel across the highway.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of apple slices Adam has:

1. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces:
   \[
   3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces:
   \[
   5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. Adding the slices from the large and small apples:
   \[
   15 \text{ slices} + 15 \text{ slices} = 30 \text{ slices}
   \]

Next, we subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices:
\[
30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices}
\]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \( \boxed{15} \).

answer:  Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs, we subtract the total number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:
\[ 8 \text{ chocolate cupcakes} + 40 \text{ toffee cupcakes} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
\[ 63 \text{ cupcakes} - 48 \text{ cupcakes} = 15 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

answer:  To determine how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Eva has saved.
2. Calculate how much money Anthony has saved.
3. Calculate how much money Roy has saved based on Anthony's savings.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva:
   \[
   \text{Anthony's savings} = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
   \]
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
   \]
   Adding this to Anthony's savings:
   \[
   \text{Roy's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
   \]

Therefore, Roy has saved \boxed{42.00}.

answer:  To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can determine the number of cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters by dividing the additional milk needed by the milk production per cow:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

answer:  To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person makes and then sum them up.

1. **Kora makes 20 clay dishes.**
2. **Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.**
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]
3. **Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.**
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of dishes made by all three:
\[
\text{Total dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140
\]

Therefore, Jada, Rory, and Kora make a total of **140** clay dishes together.

1. Calculate the initial number of cars in the parking lot.
2. Add the number of cars Hunter counted during the first break.
3. Subtract the number of cars that had left by the time he got out of class for lunch.

1. The initial number of cars in the parking lot is 50.
2. During the first break, Hunter counted 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. When he got out of class for lunch, he realized that half of the cars had left. Therefore, the number of cars that had left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]
   So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

answer:  First, let's determine the total time available for the concert, including the intermission:

- Total concert time: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes
- Total performance time: 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time each group takes to perform:

- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes
- Total time per group: 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Now, let's determine how many groups can perform in the concert:

- Total performance time: 110 minutes
- Total time per group: 10 minutes
- Number of groups: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

answer:  To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left:
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \) millimeters

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left:
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) millimeters

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left:
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) millimeters

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Becca has 153

answer:  First, calculate the annual interest rate. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Next, calculate the total interest over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Finally, add the total interest to the original investment to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, Brenda will have $975 in total after 3 years.

answer:  First, determine the number of goats sold from each farm:
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Next, calculate the number of goats left on each farm after the sale:
- Farm X: 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats

Finally, add the number of goats left on both farms to find the total:
- 45 goats (Farm X) + 25 goats (Farm Y) = 70 goats

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

answer:  To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, we add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the total monthly production to find the amount produced in the fourth week:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \]

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of socks Jack has. Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, the number of socks Peter has is:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

We also know that Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, the number of dishes Peter has is:

\[ \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Peter and Jack have a total of 90 socks and 90 dishes in total.

answer:  To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes.

First, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:
- James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the total number of pairs of shoes in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs} \]

Next, we divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes:
- James spends $2640 on shoes each year.

So, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes.

Next, find the number of white shirts without collars:
\[ \text{White shirts without collars} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, find the number of floral shirts with buttons:
\[ \text{Floral shirts with buttons} = 20 \]

Then, find the number of floral shirts without buttons:
\[ \text{Floral shirts without buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Finally, determine how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Floral shirts without buttons} - \text{White shirts without collars} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

answer:  To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of lifting abilities from Pompei to Naruto.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

To convert 480 inches to feet, we divide 480 by 12:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

answer:  To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   - The town builds 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town builds three times as many homes as in the first year.
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The town counts the total number of homes built in the first two years and doubles that amount.
   - The total number of homes built in the first two years is \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the town will have built a total of \( 144 \) new homes over the next three years.

answer:  Let's denote your brother's age as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- You are 3 years younger than your brother, so your age is \( B - 3 \).
- You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( B - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87:
\[ B + (B - 3) + (B - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5B - 6 = 87 \]

Add 6 to both sides:
\[ 5B = 93 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = 19 \]

So, your brother is 19 years old. Your age is:
\[ B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16 \]

Therefore, you are \boxed{16} years old.

Now, apply the $2 discount to each basket of red food:
\[ 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$18 \text{ per basket} - \$2 \text{ per basket} = 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$16 \text{ per basket} = \$48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food to find the total cost:
\[ \$75 + \$48 = \$123 \]

So, you will have to pay a total of \$123.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Erika already has in her purse as \( S \).

The original price of the laptop is $600, and after trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she currently has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she has from these sources is:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Therefore, the equation for the total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ S + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 350 - 230 \]
\[ S = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, let's calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply $800 by 0.10:

\[ 800 \times 0.10 = 80 \]

Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so she received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, let's find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1520 in tips altogether.

answer:  Mr. Jackson wants to give each of the 27 students 2 glue sticks. Therefore, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

answer:  First, let's determine how many loaves Paige can bake in 5 hours from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour, so in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total revenue is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins and then add the number of gold coins to it.

Given:
- Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins. According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30 \]
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins to the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

answer:  To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.
2. Determine how much money Gabriel currently has.
3. Subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:
- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800
- Total cost: $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's determine how much money Gabriel currently has:
- Money from working: $5000
- Money from brother: $200
- Total money Gabriel has: $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
- Total cost: $10800
- Total money Gabriel has: $5200
- Money still needed: $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600 more.

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

According to the problem:
1. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

answer:  To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. The total number of students in the class is 20.
2. The number of students who are good at math only is 5.
3. The number of students who perform well in English only is 8.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20 and we know that 5 students are good at math only and 8 students perform well in English only, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:

\[ 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 \]

Now, the total number of students who are good at math is the sum of the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is \( 12 \).

\[ \text{Madeline's share per week} = 60\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ dollars} = 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the cost:
\[ \text{Keenan's share per week} = 40\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ dollars} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

answer:  First, calculate the total number of jello cups needed:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, determine how many boxes of jello are needed. Each box makes 10 jello cups:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the jello. Each box costs $1.25:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend $15.00 on jello.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the number of pieces he ate on the second day:
\[ 10 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, calculate the number of pieces remaining after the second day:
\[ 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, add up all the pieces he has eaten so far:
\[ 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten is:

answer:  First, determine how many trays are needed to hold 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling the trays. Each tray is sold for $2.5, so we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

answer:  First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is \( \frac{21}{7} = $3.00 \).

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water:
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is \( \frac{8}{4} = $2.00 \).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
- The cost of 3 bottles of soda is \( 3 \times 3.00 = $9.00 \).
- The cost of 2 bottles of water is \( 2 \times 2.00 = $4.00 \).

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = $13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

answer:  To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate one-half of the rooms.
2. Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

First, let's find one-half of the rooms:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we know that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, the total time required to clean 45 rooms is:
\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

answer:  To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell.
2. Determine how many glasses Micah sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

First, we know the total number of glasses sold by all three is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell is:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses.

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 9 glasses. The difference is:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

\[ \boxed{5} \]

answer:  To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hairdo**: Iris spent $400 to do her hair.
2. **Manicure**: She spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much on the manicure as she did on the hairdo.
   \[
   \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure**: She spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all three services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Therefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

answer:  To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to follow the changes step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water:**
   - The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After a day of heavy rain:**
   - The amount of water passing through the river doubles.
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **On the third day:**
   - The volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item:

1. Bacon: 5 packs cost $10, so each pack costs $10/5 = $2.
2. Chicken: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
3. Strawberries: 3 packs cost $4 each, so the total cost is 3 * $4 = $12.
4. Apples: Each pack of apples costs half as much as a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4/2 = $2. She has 7 packs, so the total cost is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $4 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $40

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount left in her budget is:
$65 - $40 = $25

Therefore, Kelly has $25 left in her budget.

answer:  To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to account for the additional 15-minute encore and the fact that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.

Let's denote the runtime of a usual concert as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes.

Additionally, there is a 15-minute encore at the end of the concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

answer:  To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total profit from selling the original rope.
2. Calculate the total cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit.

First, let's calculate the total profit from selling the original rope:
- The rope is 20 meters long.
- Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
- Total profit = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the new rope:
- The new rope is 20 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $1.5.
- Total cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

Finally, subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit:
- Money left = Total profit - Total cost of the new rope = $40 - $30 = $10.

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

answer:  Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month. It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so it takes Amber 2 months to earn a badge. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1 year time frame, there are 12 months.

- Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges.
- Amber takes 2 months to earn a badge, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges / 2 months = 6 badges.
- Wendy earns 3 badges per month, so in 12 months, she earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

Wendy's badges - Amber's badges = 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

The answer is 30

answer:  To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit.
2. Determine the number of microphones that will fit.
3. Calculate the number of pairs that can be made from the microphones that will fit.

First, let's find the number of microphones that won't fit:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit.

Next, we calculate the number of microphones that will fit:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 microphones will fit.

Finally, we need to determine how many pairs can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that will fit by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

answer:  To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add up the number of birds in each category:

1. **Birds nesting in the bushes:**
   Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

2. **Birds flying overhead:**
   Jerry counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. Since there are 6 birds nesting in the bushes:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds flying overhead}
   \]

3. **Birds feeding:**
   Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds feeding}
   \]

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting in bushes)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds}
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[
\boxed{34}

answer:  To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of green cars.
2. Calculate the number of blue cars.
3. Find the total number of red, green, and blue cars.
4. Subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars.

1. The number of red cars is 12.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so it is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so it is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).
4. The total number of red, green, and blue cars is \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\).
5. The total number of cars in the rink is 75, so the number of yellow cars is \(75 - 52 = 23\).

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, a whirligig spins at a speed of 55 meters per second.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the number of remaining plants:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of plants that are flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

   Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.

2. **Carl's weight:**
   Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.
   \[
   \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} = 71 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Christian's weight:**
   Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \text{ kg} + 8 \text{ kg} = 79 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Harry's weight:**
   Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} = 74 \text{ kg}
   \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is \( 74 \) kg.

answer:  To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the yogurt.
2. Determine the total cost of the salad and yogurt.
3. Subtract the total cost of the salad and yogurt from the total daily cost to find the cost of the carrots.
4. Divide the cost of the carrots by 2 to find the cost of one carrot.

1. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

2. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.

3. The total daily cost for all the goods is $11. Therefore, the cost of the carrots is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.

4. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The answer is \( \boxed{1} \).

answer:  To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts:
- Each bolt costs $0.03.
- David wants to buy 16 bolts.
- Total cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt
- Total cost = 16 bolts × $0.03/bolt
- Total cost = $0.48

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:
- David has $12.48.
- Total cost of the bolts is $0.48.
- Money left = Total money David has - Total cost of the bolts
- Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
- Money left = $12.00

Therefore, after paying for the 16 bolts, David has **$12.00** left.

answer:  First, let's determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns.

1. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
2. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 * 6 = 18 times.
3. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Therefore, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 * $6 = 30 times.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
- From mowing Joe's lawn: $6
- From mowing Kamala's lawn: $18
- From mowing Alba's lawn: $30

Total from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
- Total earnings: $80
- From mowing lawns: $54

From lemonade sales: $80 - $54 = $26

answer:  First, let's calculate John's total earnings from renting out his car. He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 per hour.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} \times \$25 \text{ per hour} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 10 \times 3 \times 25 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500.

\[ \text{Car payment} = \$500 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Car payment} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$750 - \$500 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250 \]

Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 from renting out his car.

answer:  First, let's determine the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's determine the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Finally, let's add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Material for small masks: 10 yards
- Material for large masks: 6 yards
- Total material needed: \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) yards

Jo needs 16 yards of material.

answer:  To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to determine the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 \text{ miles} + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is 110 miles.

answer:  Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens} \]

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars} \]

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias's total cost of buying the chickens must be:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens for $7000, the cost per chicken is:
\[ \frac{7000}{180} = 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken} \]

Therefore, Isaias bought each chicken he took to the market for sale for $38.89.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Denise read:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so today Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages.
- Total pages Denise read: \( 10 + 18 = 28 \) pages.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Daniel read:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel did not read any pages.
- Total pages Daniel read: \( 13 + 0 = 13 \) pages.

Now, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:
- Total pages Denise read: 28 pages
- Total pages Daniel read: 13 pages
- Difference: \( 28 - 13 = 15 \) pages

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

answer:  Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now.

In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + y \). According to the problem, this age will be thrice her present age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

\[ \boxed{16} \]

answer:  To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Determine the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday.
3. Calculate his total earnings for the workday.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes per hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:
\[ 40 \text{ packages per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of packages by his pay per package:
\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

answer:  To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Determine the total amount of money Deepa spent.
3. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \).

Next, we know that Deepa spent $216 on these tickets.

Now, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket:
\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total number of tickets}} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

answer:  To find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas made each day.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

answer:  First, let's determine how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim uses to go fishing.

Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. To find out how many red shoe boxes he uses, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, Tim uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Next, let's calculate the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. After using 3 blue shoe boxes, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

After using 3 red shoe boxes, the number of red shoe boxes left is:

\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box.

The total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:

\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

So, Tim has 10 shoe boxes left.

answer:  To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum up the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ hours (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

answer:  To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals on orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals on daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of petals on the daisies and the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Difference = Total petals on daisies - Total petals on orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

answer:  First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this gives us the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, let's find the total size of both farms together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the two farms have a total of 700 acres together.

answer:  First, let's determine how long it takes for John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. Since a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, an extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours because John drinks a bottle of water every half hour:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 3 hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ half-hours per hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he will drink:

\[ 6 \text{ half-hours} \times 1 \text{ bottle per half-hour} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time he solves an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

answer:  To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Mark's new hourly wage.
2. Determine the total number of hours Mark works in a week.
3. Calculate Mark's weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked.

First, let's find Mark's new hourly wage:
- Mark used to make $10 per hour.
- They raised his pay by $2 per hour.
- New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, let's determine the total number of hours Mark works in a week:
- Mark works 8 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- Total hours per week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Finally, let's calculate Mark's weekly earnings:
- New hourly wage = $12
- Total hours per week = 40 hours
- Weekly earnings = $12/hour * 40 hours = $480/week

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups used is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

Since the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups is \( 3x \), we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 4 \]

Thus, Lana has 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

answer:  To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students participating in each activity.

1. Number of students playing tennis: 6
2. Number of students playing volleyball: twice the number of tennis players, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
3. Number of boys playing soccer: 16
4. Number of girls playing soccer: 22

Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 12 + 16 + 22 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

answer:  Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha initially had as \( M \). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks and had a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

Now, let's find out how many notebooks Joseph initially had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph initially had 6 notebooks.

After buying 5 more notebooks, Martha now has:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha now has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the total cost for the balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, their combined allowance was $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total allowance by 2:
$28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14. 

The answer is $14.

answer:  First, let's determine the calories in one mini cinnamon roll and one mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.

Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories from all pastries:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, he has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) dogs.
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, he has \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) rabbits.
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, he has \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) fish.
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish he has. Therefore, he has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7 \) gerbils.

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 47

answer:  To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of years she has been collecting shells and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

1. Calculate the number of years Martha has been collecting shells:
   - Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.
   - By her 10th birthday, she will be 10 years old.
   - Therefore, she has been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years.

2. Calculate the number of months in 5 years:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, in 5 years, there are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

3. Calculate the total number of shells Martha will have collected:
   - Martha collects one shell every month.
   - Therefore, in 60 months, she will have collected 60 shells.

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

answer:  Let's denote the age of Jean as \( J \).

Given:
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find Peter's age:
\[ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter is \(50\) years old.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bowls needed for the adults:
- Calvin: 1 adult
- His wife: 1 adult
- Total adults: 2

Next, let's determine the total number of bowls needed for the children:
- Total children: 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:
- Total bowls needed = 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls = 4 bowls

Calvin has enough soup to fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since he has enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls, he will have 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

Now, let's determine how many leftover bowls there will be:
- Total bowls available = 8 child bowls
- Total bowls needed = 4 bowls
- Leftover bowls = 8 child bowls - 4 adult bowls = 4 child bowls

Since there are 2 children, each child will have:
- Leftover bowls per child = 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls

Therefore, each child will have 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

answer:  To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine the number of berries per trip.

First, let's find the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours to make one trip, we divide the total time by the time it takes for one trip:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of berries per trip. We know the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total. So, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12 berries.

answer:  Colby already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost 5 * $10 = $50.
He also saw 8 movies on other days, which cost 8 * $7 = $56.
He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost 2 * $8 = $16.
He bought 4 boxes of candy, which cost 4 * $2 = $8.
In total, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.
He started with $150 to spend, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.
On Friday, he wants to buy popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.
So, he has $20 - $10 = $10 left to spend on movie tickets.
Since tickets on a Friday or Saturday cost $10, he can buy $10 / $10 = 1 movie on Friday.
Therefore, he can see a total of 5 movies already seen + 1 more movie = 6 movies.

10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking)} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total 24 hours in a day to find the free time:
\[
24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left over in his day.

answer:  To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum up the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5 days) to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

So, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60 Junebugs.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled:
\[ 20 \text{ words} \times 15 \text{ letters/word} = 300 \text{ letters} \]

Next, determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. Since his brother has spelled words with 50 more letters than Craig, we calculate:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 350 \text{ letters} \]

Now, add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 350 \text{ letters} = 650 \text{ letters} \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650 letters.

answer:  Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

Duncan's age eight years ago was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

answer:  To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls.
2. Subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls:

- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

So, Sophie had 48 toys before buying the bouncy balls.

Next, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[
\boxed{14}

answer:  To determine the total number of water balloons the girls have, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - Maria has 4 friends.
   - Each friend receives 2 water balloons.
   - Total balloons given to friends: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)

2. **Maria's Balloons:**
   - Maria keeps 1 water balloon for herself.
   - Total balloons after Maria: \( 8 + 1 = 9 \)

3. **Mom's Distribution:**
   - Maria's mom gives each person 3 more water balloons.
   - There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends).
   - Total balloons added by mom: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)

4. **Total Balloons:**
   - Total balloons after Maria: \( 9 \)
   - Total balloons added by mom: \( 15 \)
   - Total number of water balloons: \( 9 + 15 = 24 \)

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls have is \(\boxed{24 balloons}\).

answer:  To determine the number of yellow balloons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons.
2. Subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces thrown to find the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons.
3. Determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, find the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, determine the number of yellow balloons:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

answer:  To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney and then find the average of those distances.

First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.
- Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Next, let's calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.
- Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Finally, we find the average distance:
- Average distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet per person.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James sells 5 CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Adding the money he received to the money he spent:

\[ \$90 + \$200 = \$290 \]

To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he received from the amount he spent:

\[ \$290 - \$90 = \$200 \]

Therefore, James was out \$200.

answer:  To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Abby and Josh per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by this amount.

First, let's find out how many slices Abby and Josh eat per day:
- Abby eats 2 slices a day.
- Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices consumed per day by both Abby and Josh:
- Total slices per day = Abby's slices per day + Josh's slices per day
- Total slices per day = 2 slices/day + 4 slices/day = 6 slices/day

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the total number of slices consumed per day to find out how many days the bread will last:
- Total slices in the loaf = 24 slices
- Number of days = Total slices / Total slices per day
- Number of days = 24 slices / 6 slices/day = 4 days

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

answer:  To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per paper.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch.
- Each paper is printed on both sides, so each paper contains 2 pages.

First, calculate the total number of sheets of paper in the book:
\[ \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Thickness of the book}}{\text{Pages per inch}} \]
\[ \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{1.5 \text{ inches}}{100 \text{ pages/inch}} = 0.15 \text{ sheets} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pages in the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Number of sheets} \times \text{Pages per sheet} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 0.15 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 3 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages.

answer:  Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house, $35 per hour for labor, and $60 for parts. The job took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts.

First, let's calculate the labor cost:
\[ \text{Labor cost} = \$35 \text{ per hour} \times 2.25 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Labor cost} = \$78.75 \]

Next, let's add the cost of the parts:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Visit charge} + \text{Labor cost} + \text{Parts cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$40 + \$78.75 + \$60 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the job.

answer:  To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children per school and then multiply by the number of schools.

1. Calculate the number of children per school:
   - There are 8 children in each row.
   - There are 7 rows per school.
   - Therefore, the number of children per school is:
     \[
     8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school}
     \]

2. Calculate the total number of children for all schools:
   - There are 5 schools.
   - Therefore, the total number of children for all schools is:
     \[
     56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children}
     \]

So, there can be 280 children in the drill.

answer:  To determine how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water initially in the tank.
2. Determine the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

First, calculate the amount of water initially in the tank:
\[ \text{Initial water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water used over 6 days:
\[ \text{Total water used} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:
\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

answer:  To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Number of yams: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 from selling all her root crops.

answer:  To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given:
- Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
- The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]
3. The bakery has 40 less than 490 loaves:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

So, the number of loaves of bread the bakery has is:

\[
\boxed{450}
\]

answer:  The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of the beds are occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied beds is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Initially, the number of unoccupied beds is:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Since each patient requires one bed, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ 100 \]

answer:  To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
- Distance traveled by the bus = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
- Distance traveled by the car = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles
- Distance traveled by the car: 240 miles
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is 60 miles.

answer:  Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by the team is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

- Commission per copy of the New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50

Next, calculate the commission for each copy of the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20

Now, calculate the total commission from 6 copies of the New York Times:
- Total commission from the New York Times = 6 copies * $0.50/copy = $3.00

Next, calculate the total commission from 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal:
- Total commission from the Wall Street Journal = 10 copies * $1.20/copy = $12.00

Finally, add the total commissions from both types of newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00 in total.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so the total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

answer:  Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as \( x \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2x \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

Now, we can find the number of balls carried by Jordan and Jason:
- Jordan carried \( 4x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.
- Jason carried \( 2x = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ 7 \]

So, the coach brought 7 balls.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, he has:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

To find the total number of utensils (measuring cups and measuring spoons) Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons he has left:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \text{ utensils} \]

answer:  To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time intervals he spent stapling and then multiply that by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 3 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 180 minutes:
- 180 minutes divided by 15 minutes per interval is \(180 \div 15 = 12\) intervals.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 12 intervals, he can staple:
- 12 intervals \(\times\) 30 reports per interval = \(12 \times 30 = 360\) reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 360 reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

answer:  First, calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, calculate the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

answer:  To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

Courtney reported that the audience was 48, which is 20% more than the actual number of people. This can be expressed as:

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemed to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

2. Determine how many of those remaining emails are to her family.
3. Calculate the number of emails sent to her boyfriend.

First, let's find the number of emails that are not work emails:
- Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.
- 7 of these are work emails.
- Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is \( 16 - 7 = 9 \).

Next, we determine how many of these remaining emails are to her family:
- Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family.
- So, the number of emails to her family is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \).

Finally, we calculate the number of emails sent to her boyfriend:
- One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend.
- Therefore, the number of emails to her boyfriend is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \).

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Next, we calculate the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \]

So, Nani's sister's age is:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members to find the total age:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is:

answer:  To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = \text{perimeter} \times \text{slats per foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ slats/foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and then add it to the cost of the supplies.

1. **Calculate the cost of the tickets:**
   - The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
   - The cost of the supplies is $400.
   - To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.50:
     \[
     400 \times 0.50 = 200
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the tickets is:
     \[
     400 + 200 = 600
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the travel:**
   - The cost of the supplies is $400.
   - The cost of the tickets is $600.
   - The total cost of the travel is:
     \[
     400 + 600 = 1000
     \]

So, the travel costs $1000.

answer:  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim the first 12 miles.
After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
He swims this remaining distance at half the speed of 2 miles per hour, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
It takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.
The total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug in the first three days:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes in the first three days = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

Next, we need to determine the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

Total holes at the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes

Now, we can calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes from the first three days from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:

Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 31 = 9 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 9 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

answer:  To determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries each person has.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) cherries.
3. Let \( J \) represent the number of cherries Jerry has.

The total number of cherries shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 30 + 20 + J = 60 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ 50 + J = 60 \]
\[ J = 60 - 50 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. The difference is:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has **20** more cherries than Jerry.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of brownies Greta had:

1. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. Her office sent her 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

So, Greta had a total of 66 brownies.

Next, we need to find out how many brownies were eaten during the party:

1. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

answer:  First, let's determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Let \( L \) represent Leo's age. According to the problem, Marcus is half of Leo's age:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{L}{2} \]

Since Marcus's age is 21, we can set up the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{L}{2} \]

To find Leo's age, we solve for \( L \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Minutes per episode} \]

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes in total.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes. Therefore, the total time is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Minutes per episode} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show in total.

1. Determine the number of players in Carlton's team.
2. Calculate the number of players in Zeke's team based on the given information.
3. Add the number of players in both teams to get the total.

Step 1: Determine the number of players in Carlton's team.
Carlton's team has 13 players.

Step 2: Calculate the number of players in Zeke's team.
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Therefore, we add 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]
So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Step 3: Add the number of players in both teams to get the total.
To find the total number of players, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team:
\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is \boxed{33}.

1. **Synthetic gut racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes

2. **Polyester string racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes

3. **Hybrid set racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid set racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add up the total time for all the racquets:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

answer:  First, let's determine how old Emil will be when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19 years old, he will be:

\[ 19 + 5 = 24 \]

So, Emil will be 24 years old when he turns 24.

At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, his dad will be:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

So, Emil's dad will be 48 years old when he turns 24.

At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, his brother will be:

\[ 24 \div 2 = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother will be 12 years old when he turns 24.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:

\[ 48 + 12 = 60 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

\[
\boxed{60}

answer:  Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours.
On that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes.
To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking from the time she woke up.
5:55 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours and 40 minutes.
3 hours and 40 minutes is equal to 3 * 60 + 40 = 220 minutes.
To find the time she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she spent sleepwalking from the total time she was in bed.
220 minutes - 23 minutes = 197 minutes.
Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 197 minutes that day.

answer:  To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the books.
2. Subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from the total cost.
3. Determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the books:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from the total cost:
- Amount saved: $14

Remaining amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Remaining amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining amount:
- Hourly wage: $5

Number of hours needed = Remaining amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books.

answer:  To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots.
3. Divide the total size by 2 to find the average.

First, let's find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we calculate:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots:

\[ \text{Total size} = \text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total size by 2 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15.

answer:  Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges she bought is:

\[ 12 \times 20 = 240 \text{ oranges} \]

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which means she gave away:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ oranges} \]

After giving away 40 oranges, the number of oranges left is:

\[ 240 - 40 = 200 \text{ oranges} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges she kept is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 200 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

The rest of the oranges were sold. So, the number of oranges sold is:

\[ 200 - 50 = 150 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 150 oranges.

answer:  To determine the age of Shawna's father, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Aliya's age.
2. Determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age.
3. Calculate Shawna's father's age based on Shawna's age.

Step 1: Identify Aliya's age.
Aliya is 3 years old.

Step 2: Determine Shawna's age.
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Step 3: Calculate Shawna's father's age.
Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Thus, Shawna's father is \( \boxed{45} \) years old.

answer:  To find the total cost of both cars, we first need to determine the price of the red car. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

1. Calculate 40% of the price of the blue car:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40
   \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60
   \]

3. Add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car to find the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price of the blue car} + \text{Price of the red car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses.

\boxed{3}

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boxes sold on each day:

- Saturday:
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
  - Apple pie: 4 fewer than on Sunday, so 15 - 4 = 11 boxes

- Sunday:
  - Gingerbread: 5 more than on Saturday, so 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday:
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
  - Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15/box = $165

- Sunday:
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225

Now, let's add up the earnings for both days:

- Total earnings = $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $580

Therefore, Sunny earned $580 over the two days.

answer:  To determine Bill's age when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet.
2. Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time.
3. Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting the 75-year orbital period.

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from his age when he saw the comet the second time:
   \[
   90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old}
   \]

The answer is 15 years old.

answer:  To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add up the beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend.

1. **Beads given by her mother:**
   - Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

2. **Beads given by her sister:**
   - Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother.
   - Therefore, her sister gave her \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) beads.

3. **Beads given by her friend:**
   - Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.
   - Therefore, her friend gave her \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads she received:
- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total number of beads:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads altogether.

answer:  To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First segment:**
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second segment:**
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third segment:**
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments:
- Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.

   - Cost per petunia: $3.00
   - Total cost for petunias: \( 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \)

   - Number of sweet potato vines: 2
   - Cost per sweet potato vine: $2.50
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines: \( 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \)

   - Total cost for one basket: \( 9.00 + 5.00 = 14.00 \)

2. Calculate the total cost for 5 baskets:
   - Total cost for one basket: $14.00
   - Total cost for 5 baskets: \( 5 \times 14.00 = 70.00 \)

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

answer:  To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father.
2. Subtract the total amount received from his mother and father from the total cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

- His mother gave him $6.
- His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount received from his mother and father is:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:

The total cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Adam had to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.

answer:  John decides to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which means he needs to buy 4 phones in total. The price of each phone is $600, but each phone after the first two is half price.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first two phones:
- The first phone costs $600.
- The second phone costs $600.

Total cost for the first two phones = $600 + $600 = $1200.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the remaining two phones:
- The third phone costs half of $600, which is $300.
- The fourth phone costs half of $600, which is $300.

Total cost for the remaining two phones = $300 + $300 = $600.

Now, let's add the costs for all four phones:
- Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

answer:  First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Each flower grows 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each plant. Therefore, the number of plants needed is:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44 \text{ plants} \]

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = $162 \]

Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

answer:  First, calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner:
- On low mode for 3 hours: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees
- On high mode for 4 hours: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

Total cooling effect of the air conditioner:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Next, calculate the total warming effect of the room without the air conditioner:
- Room off for 2 hours: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Total warming effect:
4 degrees

Now, calculate the net temperature change:
- Cooling effect: 18 degrees
- Warming effect: 4 degrees

Net temperature change:
18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is positive, the room was cooled by 14 degrees.

To find out how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to know the starting temperature. However, since the starting temperature is not provided, we can only say the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

answer:  To determine the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of states in the USA.
2. Calculate the number of states in India based on the given relationship.
3. Add the number of states in both countries to find the total.

**Step 1: Identify the number of states in the USA.**
The USA has 50 states.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of states in India.**
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. First, we find half the number of states in the USA:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
Then, we add 4 to this result:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]
So, India has 29 states.

**Step 3: Add the number of states in both countries.**
Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ 79 \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of slices each kid gets. Since there are 4 kids and each kid gets a slice, the total number of slices for the kids is:

\[ 4 \text{ kids} \times 1 \text{ slice per kid} = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, each adult gets:

\[ 2 \text{ adults} \times 2 \text{ slices per adult} = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices in the watermelon:

\[ 4 \text{ slices for kids} + 4 \text{ slices for adults} = 8 \text{ slices} \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices}} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, calculate how much money she sets aside in a year. There are 12 months in a year:

\[ \$500.00 \text{ per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = \$6,000.00 \]

Now, determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00:

\[ \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00 \text{ per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

answer:  To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to break down the costs and revenues.

1. **Cost per Session:**
   - Fixed cost to rent the studio: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session: $25 + $1.50/student * 10 students = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Sessions per Week:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.
   - Total sessions per week: 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   - Total cost per session: $40
   - Total earnings per week: $40/session * 12 sessions/week = $480/week

4. **Total Monthly Earnings:**
   - Total earnings per week: $480/week
   - Total earnings per month: $480/week * 4 weeks/month = $1920/month

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$1920**.

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings Joe has, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by the pounds per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The answer is \( \boxed{7} \).

answer:  To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks**:
   - He writes 1 check per month.
   - In a year, he writes 12 checks.

2. **Gas bill checks**:
   - He writes 1 check per month.
   - In a year, he writes 12 checks.

3. **Church checks**:
   - He writes 2 checks per month.
   - In a year, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks.

4. **Pest and lawn service checks**:
   - He writes 1 check every 4 months.
   - In a year, he writes \(\frac{12}{4} = 3\) checks.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 + 12 + 24 + 3 = 51 \]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 51 checks per year.

The answer is \( \boxed{51} \).

answer:  To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks and then sum them up.

1. **Red sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue sticks:**
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

Therefore, they have a total of 34 sticks.

answer:  Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in one box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

The total number of chocolate bars sold by both Lisa and Peter is given as 64. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

answer:  To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.
2. Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

First, we know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount by 7:

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

answer:  On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
In total, Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.
The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so there are 18000 - 7500 - 4500 = 6000 gallons remaining.

answer:  First, let's determine the average age of the group. Since the total age of the children is 20 and there are 4 children, the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years} \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years} \]

Next, we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[ \text{Akbar's age} = 3 \text{ years} \]
\[ \text{Alessandro's age} = 4 \text{ years} \]

The total age of the children is 20, so Wilfred's age can be calculated by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age:

\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 5.9:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost to fill the pool is $826.

answer:  To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sauteing the shrimp.

1. **Peeling the shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, she will need \( 90 \text{ shrimp} \div 6 \text{ shrimp/minute} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Sauteing the shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, she will need \( 90 \text{ shrimp} \div 30 \text{ shrimp/set} \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we add the time for peeling and sauteing to find the total time:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine how many pieces Anne kept for herself:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, subtract the number of pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces she gave to her friends:
\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:
\[ 780 \text{ pieces} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

1. **Bethany** runs 10 laps in one hour.
2. **Trey** runs 4 more laps than Bethany:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps}
   \]
3. **Shaelyn** runs half as many laps as Trey:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps}
   \]
4. **Quinn** runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps}
   \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of laps Bethany can run and the number of laps Quinn can run:
\[
\text{Difference} = 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps}
\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time spent on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes 20 minutes to check each one:

\[ 9 \times 20 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:

\[ 180 + 300 = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic, which is equivalent to:

\[ 9 \times 60 = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the total time available at the clinic:

\[ 540 - 480 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 60 minutes left to update his records.

   The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

3. **Guests who opted for a late checkout:**
   15 guests opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]

5. **Guests who checked in after dinner:**
   7 more guests checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pe = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Total cost of these fruits: $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy is:
$0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the remaining money.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

Given that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. Therefore, the second plane makes \( \frac{1}{2}F \) trips.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}F = 44 \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 \]
\[ F = 88 \]

So, the first plane takes \( \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \) flights to France.

answer:  Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ 7M = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( M \):
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box, and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we calculate:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

answer:  To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches each person eats in a day and then sum them up.

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one day:

\[ \text{Total sandwiches per day} = \text{Man's sandwiches} + \text{Wife's sandwiches} + \text{Son's sandwiches} \]
\[ \text{Total sandwiches per day} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week. There are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Total sandwiches per week} = \text{Total sandwiches per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total sandwiches per week} = 11 \times 7 = 77 \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

answer:  To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time Matteo traveled: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time Shandy traveled: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, find the difference in distance between Shandy and Matteo:
Difference = Distance Shandy - Distance Matteo
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

answer:  To determine how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages of his book. We know that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

First, let's find out how many pages James can read in 1 minute:

\[ \text{Pages per minute} = \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to read 18 pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ pages per minute}} \]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading his book.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of money Walter has collected so far:

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from the online fund.
3. Walter collects $200 from his friend.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected so far:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

answer:  Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost is:
\[ 5 \times 0.09C = 0.45C \]

During the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost is:
\[ 3 \times 0.07C = 0.21C \]

The total charge lost over the 8 hours is:
\[ 0.45C + 0.21C = 0.66C \]

We know that the remaining charge is 28% of the initial charge. Therefore:
\[ 0.34C = 0.28 \]

To find \( C \), we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.34} \]
\[ C = 0.8 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank was 80%.

answer:  Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as \( S \). According to the problem, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of large stuffed animals she sold is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

Each small stuffed animal costs $4, and each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

The total earnings from the small stuffed animals is \( 4S \) dollars, and the total earnings from the large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times \frac{S}{2} = 6S \) dollars.

The total earnings from all the stuffed animals is the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals:
\[ 4S + 6S = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 10S = 120 \]

Solving for \( S \), we divide both sides by 10:
\[ S = \frac{120}{10} = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold \( 12 \) small stuffed animals.

answer:  To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for the given packages and then use that to calculate the cost for 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich for the third package is also $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Price per sandwich = $1.50.
- Number of sandwiches = 8.
- Total cost = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.00.

answer:  To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for each step and then subtract that from the desired finish time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Since 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

answer:  To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and then add it to the initial price.

1. Initial price: $120
2. First year increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - Price after the first year: $120 + $6 = $126
3. Second year increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - Price after the second year: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30
4. Third year increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - Price after the third year: $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

answer:  One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.
In a month with 30 days, one dwarf can mine 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds of ore.
Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. The total population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines} = 30 \times 4 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, we add the total number of baby porcupines to the original population of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.

answer:  To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people attending the graduation.
2. Subtract the number of graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
3. Divide the remaining tickets by the number of graduates.

First, let's find the total number of people attending the graduation:
- Graduates: 950
- Faculty: 300
- Total attendees = 950 + 300 = 1250

Next, we subtract the number of graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center:
- Total capacity: 6000
- Total attendees: 1250
- Remaining tickets = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Finally, we divide the remaining tickets by the number of graduates:
- Remaining tickets: 4750
- Graduates: 950
- Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

answer:  To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to add up the number of bananas he picked each day.

- On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
- On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
- On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas on Friday.

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[ 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \]

Therefore, John has a total of 22 bananas.

3000 / 2 = 1500 students

Next, find the number of male students over 16 years old:
1500 * (1/4) = 375 students

Then, find the number of female students over 16 years old:
1500 - 375 = 1125 students

Now, find the number of students under 16 years old:
3000 - 1500 = 1500 students

Next, find the number of male students under 16 years old:
1500 * (1/2) = 750 students

Then, find the number of female students under 16 years old:
1500 - 750 = 750 students

Finally, add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students:
1125 + 750 = 1875 students

The answer is 1875.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard needs to place along the driveway.
2. Determine the time it takes to move from one soda bottle to the next.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles:
- The driveway is 24 feet wide.
- Richard wants to place a soda bottle every 3 feet.

So, the number of bottles is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next:
- It takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.

Since there are 8 bottles, the total time to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ 8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Richard a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

answer:  Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$80 \]

She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 \text{ per cupcake} = \$240 \]

Her total earnings from cookies and cupcakes are:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ sisters} \times \$10 \text{ per sister} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

answer:  To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the different scenarios where he might avoid turning it in.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher:** 50%
2. **Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension:** 40%
3. **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension if the whole class doesn't get an extension:** 20%

First, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of having a substitute teacher:** 50%
- **Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension:** 40%
- **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension if the whole class doesn't get an extension:** 20%

Adding these probabilities together:

\[ 50\% + 40\% + 20\% = 110\% \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 100\% - 110\% = 0\% \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 0%.

answer:  First, determine the dimensions of each piece of fabric:
- The bed is 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece of fabric = Length * Width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area required is:
- Total area = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

- Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
- Total weekly earnings: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Next, determine the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment:
- Down payment: 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Now, calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000:
- Weeks needed: $2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

answer:  To determine how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining cost after selling the old bedroom:**
   - Tom buys the bedroom set for $3000.
   - He sells his old bedroom for $1000.
   - Remaining cost = $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

2. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   - Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining cost each month.
   - Monthly payment = 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

answer:  To find out how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the books:
Ted buys 3 books, and each book costs $16.
\[ 3 \text{ books} \times \$16 \text{ per book} = \$48 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
Ted buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6.
\[ 3 \text{ pencils} \times \$6 \text{ per pencil} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$48 + \$18 = \$66 \]

So, Ted spent a total of \$66.

answer:  To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the population of each country and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the population of one country:
   - Each country has 5 cities.
   - Each city has 1000 people.
   - Therefore, the population of one country is:
     \[
     5 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people/city} = 5000 \text{ people}
     \]

2. Calculate the total population of all 26 countries:
   - There are 26 countries in South America.
   - Each country has a population of 5000 people.
   - Therefore, the total population of South America is:
     \[
     26 \text{ countries} \times 5000 \text{ people(country} = 130,000 \text{ people}
     \]

So, the total population of South America is:

\[
130,000 \text{ people}
\]

answer:  To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat.
2. Convert the number of medium-sized beans into small beans.

First, we know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, to convert the number of medium-sized beans into small beans, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:
\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

answer:  To determine how many portraits and selfies Olivia has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pictures in each album.
2. Determine the number of pictures in the selfie albums.
3. Determine the number of pictures in the portrait albums.

First, let's find out how many pictures are in each album:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]
So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only:
\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
So, Olivia has 27 selfies.

Then, we know that 2 of the albums are portraits:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
So, Olivia has 18 portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia has is:
\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

answer:  First, calculate the total loan amount Jim received:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, determine Jim's income before and after college:
Original income: $25,000/year
After college, his income tripled: $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Now, calculate the income Jim lost while in school:
$75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year

Add the loan amount and the income lost to find the total amount Jim needs to earn:
$200,000 + $50,000/year = $250,000

Finally, determine how long it would take Jim to earn $250,000 at his new income:
$250,000 / $75,000/year = 3 years

So, it would take Jim 3 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

answer:  Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of tennis balls retrieved is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 15 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, Rory retrieved 7.5 tennis balls in the second set.

In the first set, he retrieved:
\[ x + 4 = 7.5 + 4 = 11.5 \] tennis balls.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:

- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24
- Average questions: (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to answer correctly in each category:

- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

Finally, let's add up the number of correct answers:

- Total correct answers = 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

answer:  To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
- Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
- Over 30 days, she drinks:
  \[
  8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon:
- To convert 240 cups to gallons, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

answer:  To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. Since he lost $5, he won:
   \[
   2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11, he lost:
   \[
   1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total amount lost:
\[
5 + 11 + 16.5 = 32.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

The average amount lost per race is:
\[
\frac{32.5}{3} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}

answer:  To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, on Tuesday: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, on Wednesday: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, we sum up the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the post office delivered \( 736 \) letters from Monday to Wednesday.

2. Subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs hidden.
3. Subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by their friends from the remaining eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins:
\[ 30 \text{ eggs/twin} \times 2 \text{ twins} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs hidden:

Finally, subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by their friends from the remaining eggs:
\[ 40 \text{ eggs} - 10 \text{ eggs} = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the friends found:
\[ \boxed{30} \text{ eggs} \]

answer:  To determine how much James pays a year for his insurance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to get the annual cost.

First, let's find the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 per month.
- The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost.
- To find 60% of $120, we multiply $120 by 0.60:
  \[
  120 \times 0.60 = 72
  \]
- Therefore, the increased monthly cost is:
  \[
  120 + 72 = 192
  \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the increased monthly cost by 12:
- The monthly cost is $192.
- The annual cost is:
  \[
  192 \times 12 = 2304
  \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

answer:  To find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's heights now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Xavier's height from feet to inches.
2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height.
3. Add the growth to Cole's initial height.
4. Calculate the difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights.

1. Convert Xavier's height from feet to inches:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - Xavier's initial height = 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
   - Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

3. Add the growth to Cole's initial height:
   - Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

4. Calculate the difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights:
   - Difference = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
   - Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

Therefore, the difference between Cole's and Xavier's heights now is 1 inch.

answer:  To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team in 3 weeks.
2. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:

- The team worked for 3 weeks, which is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- They worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

So, the total number of hours worked is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = 21 \times 0.375 = 8.625 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter:
\[ \frac{8.625}{4} = 2.15625 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in approximately 2.16 hours of work.

answer:  To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all three cats.

Each cat is fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/feed} \times 2 \text{ feeds/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

\[  2 \text{ days} \]

answer:  To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven.
2. Subtract the distance she has driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven:
- She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- Therefore, the total distance she has driven is:
  \[
  325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km}
  \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City:
- The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers.
- Therefore, the distance she still needs to drive is:
  \[
  1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km}
  \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]
red balloons remaining.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]
yellow balloons remaining.

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, she added 6 blue balloons, making the total number of yellow balloons:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Finally, we add up all the remaining balloons:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

Therefore, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school.

answer:  To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the three years from 2007 to 2010.

First, calculate the depreciation for each year:
- Year 1: $20000 * 21% = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
- Year 2: $20000 * 21% = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
- Year 3: $20000 * 21% = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200

Next, calculate the total depreciation over the three years:
Total depreciation = $4200 + $4200 + $4200 = $12600

Finally, subtract the total depreciation from the original price of the car:
Price of the car in 2010 = $20000 - $12600 = $7400

answer:  To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response each day.
2. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
3. Multiply the number of emails that require a response each day by the number of days in a week.

First, calculate the number of emails that don't require a response each day:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

Next, calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:
\[ \text{Total emails per day} - \text{Emails that don't require a response} = 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Now, multiply the number of emails that require a response each day by the number of days in a week:
\[ \text{Emails per day} \times 5 = 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   \[
   120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 20 people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 50 people descend from the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   - Twice the number of people who descended board the train.
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
   So, 100 people board the train.
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - 80 people descend from the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \boxed{110}.

Next, let's calculate her total daily earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she works to find her jury pay per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa's jury pay per hour after expenses is:

answer:  To determine the cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the kitchen floor.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed to cover the floor.
3. Calculate the total cost of the tiles.

1. The area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet.
2. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is equal to the area of the kitchen floor:
   \[
   \text{Number of tiles} = 200 \text{ square feet}
   \]
3. Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$2400
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\).

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18 \]

Now, add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent on cheese:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Finally, subtract the total amount spent on cheese from the initial amount of cash Amor has:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, Amor will have \$10 left to buy meat.

answer:  First, determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, he wants to send out:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Next, calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the cost for 700 small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 0.05 = 350 \text{ cents} \]

Then, calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the cost for 1400 big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 0.15 = 2100 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons to find the total postage cost:
\[ 350 + 2100 = 2450 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 2450 cents on postage.

answer:  To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add the number of stickers he has collected over the past two years to the initial number of stickers he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year.

First, let's calculate the number of stickers Leo collected this year. Since he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, we have:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, Leo collected 100 stickers this year.

Next, we add the stickers collected last year and this year:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the total number of stickers collected over the past two years to the initial number of stickers he had two years ago:
\[ 100 + 150 = 250 \]

Therefore, Leo has a total of 250 stickers in his collection.

answer:  First, let's determine how many sets of sheets Greg uses each week:

- He has 4 twin beds, and each twin bed has 2 sets of sheets, so he uses \(4 \times 2 = 8\) twin sets per week.
- He also has 1 king-size bed, and each king-size bed has 2 sets of sheets, so he uses \(1 \times 2 = 2\) king sets per week.
- Therefore, he uses a total of \(8 + 2 = 10\) sets of sheets per week.

Next, let's determine how many loads of laundry he does each week:

- His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, which is \(2 + 1 = 3\) sets per load.
- Therefore, he does \(\frac{10}{3} = 4\) loads of laundry per week.

Finally, let's calculate how many loads of laundry he does in a year:

- There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does \(4 \times 52 = 208\) loads per year.

answer:  To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for both the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- Number of people wanting the chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for the chicken salad: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $65.00

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting the pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for the pasta salad: $6
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6/person = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering:
- Total cost = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people Kayla invited:
- Classmates: 25
- Girls in dance class: 7
- Family members: 13

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we subtract the number of people who could not come:
- People who could not come: 4

Total guests = 45 - 4 = 41

Now, let's calculate the cost of renting the theater:
- Base fee for 20 guests: $125
- Additional cost per guest: $6

First, find the number of additional guests:
- Additional guests = Total guests - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

Next, calculate the additional cost for the additional guests:
- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, add the base fee and the additional cost:
- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party will be $251.

answer:  Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, and Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate:

\[ 7 \text{ slices} \times 2 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 \text{ slices (Becky)} + 7 \text{ slices (Jake)} + 14 \text{ slices (Silvia)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]

answer:  To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. **Cost of the cast:** $200

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit:**
   - The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   - The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   - Total cost for the visit = $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

3. **Cost of the painkillers:**
   - Hannah needs 30 painkillers.
   - Each pill costs $4.
   - Total cost for painkillers = 30 pills * $4/pill = $120

4. **Cost of parking:**
   - Hannah needs a minimum of 2 hours of parking.
   - Parking costs $6 per hour.
   - Total cost for parking = $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, add up all the costs:
$200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

answer:  To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, so \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, add these numbers together:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the 15 roses. Since each rose costs $2, the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jenny has. She paid with five 5 dollar bills, which is:

\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5 \text{ per bill} = \$25 \]

Now, let's find out how much change Jenny should receive after buying the roses:

\[ \$25 - \$30 = \$5 \]

Since the florist only gives quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters are needed to make up the $5 change. Each quarter is worth $0.25.

To find the number of quarters, we divide the total change by the value of one quarter:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25 \text{ per quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters.

answer:  First, determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, calculate the total number of meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches:
\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Then, account for the sub sandwiches Mark ate:
\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Now, calculate the number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Finally, add the meatballs from the additional 3 sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:
\[ 28 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[ 40 \]

answer:  The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the sale price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is the difference between the original price and the selling price:

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend received a 10% discount on the original price of the watch.

answer:  To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to add up the cost of each item she bought, taking into account any discounts or coupons.

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: $8 with a coupon for $2 off, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Tank top} + \text{Running shorts} + \text{Tennis shoes} + \text{Athletic socks} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$55 \]

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.

answer:  First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound and get one half off. This means for every pound of butter, you only need to pay for half a pound. Therefore, to get 6 pounds of butter, Dennis only needs to pay for:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, the total cost for 3 pounds of butter is:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Dennis $12.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.

The answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bananas Jenny buys. She buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \text{Maggie's spending} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money:
\[ \text{Riza's spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money each person has left.

Maggie's remaining money:
\[ \text{Maggie's remaining money} = 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza's remaining money:
\[ \text{Riza's remaining money} = 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Finally, let's find the total amount of money the two of them have left:
\[ \text{Total remaining money} = \text{Maggie's remaining money} + \text{Riza's remaining money} = 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the two of them have left is \( \boxed{85} \).

answer:  To determine how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to 4 weeks.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies on Sunday.

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Movies watched on Saturday: 4
   - Movies watched on Sunday: 2
   - Total movies in one weekend: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - There are 2 weekends in a week.
   - Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) weekends.
   - Total movies in 4 weeks: \( 8 \times 6 = 48 \)

So, Jill and her friends can watch a total of 48 movies in 4 weeks.

answer:  To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
   - Revenue from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $<<6*5.50=33>>33

2. **Burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
   - Revenue from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $<<9*11=99>>99

3. **Soda:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
   - Revenue from soda = 20 * $1.50 = $<<20*1.50=30>>30

Now, add up the revenues from all the items:
- Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $<<33+99+30=162>>162

Terry makes a total of $162.

answer:  To determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we need to break down the problem into two parts:

1. Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle.
2. Teddy started and finished another 500-piece puzzle.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Teddy placed in the first part:
- Half of a 500-piece puzzle is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) pieces.

Next, let's calculate the number of pieces Teddy placed in the second part:
- Teddy started and finished another 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed all 500 pieces of that puzzle.

Now, we add the pieces placed in both parts:
- Total pieces placed = 250 pieces (first part) + 500 pieces (second part) = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

answer:  To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck over the 6-hour day.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
- Total bales left = Total bales produced - Total bales picked up
- Total bales left = 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

The answer is 12 bales.

answer:  Let's denote the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for making the meal is the sum of the time it took for Betsy's part and Donovan's part, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

answer:  To determine how many more weeks Melanie needs to save to collect 200 toothpicks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved.
2. Determine how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks.

First, let's calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we determine how many more toothpicks she needs:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Finally, we calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

answer:  To determine how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one minute.
2. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour.
3. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in four hours.
4. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in four hours.

1. One spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.
2. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so one spring creates 60 jellyfish in one minute.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so one spring creates 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish in one hour.
4. In four hours, one spring creates 3600 * 4 = 14400 jellyfish.
5. 5 springs would create 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish in four hours.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

answer:  First, determine how many bags of apples were sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples.

answer:  To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests.
2. Add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests.
3. Divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \]

Next, add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests:
\[ 300 + 80 = 380 \]

Finally, divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

answer:  To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first train:**
   - Speed of the first train: 60 miles per hour
   - Time traveled: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second train:**
   - Speed of the second train: 30 miles per hour (half of 60 miles per hour)
   - Time traveled: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

3. **Total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance of the first train + Distance of the second train = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles from each other.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount Harry gets from the total amount:
\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

answer:  To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trucks dispatched.
2. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilisers.
4. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks.

1. The total number of trucks dispatched is 20.
2. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks with mechanical failures is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
3. The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilisers is:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]
4. Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is \(\boxed{300}\).

answer:  To determine the total time James took to reach the store, we need to consider both the time he walked to the store and the time he walked back home.

1. **Time to the store:**
   - Distance to the store: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

2. **Time back home:**
   - Distance back home: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

3. **Total time:**
   - Time to the store: 1 hour
   - Time back home: 0.5 hours
   - Total time = 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Therefore, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store.

answer:  To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest, we need to calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest waterslide: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest waterslide: 80 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time between the biggest and the second biggest waterslide:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest waterslide - Time for the second biggest waterslide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, the answer is 2 minutes.

answer:  Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes. 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes. The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.
The price of one Trekking bike is $450, so he earned 150 * $450 = $6750 from Trekking bikes.
The price of one BMX bike is $250, so he earned 45 * $250 = $1125 from BMX bikes.
The price of one MTB bike is $500, so he earned 105 * $500 = $5250 from MTB bikes.
In total, Marcel earned $6750 + $1125 + $5250 = $13125.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day:
10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day:
10 bananas/day + 4 bananas/day = 14 bananas/day
14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas

Now, let's find the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
70 bananas + 98 bananas = 168 bananas

Next, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week:
315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas

Finally, we divide the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas/day

Therefore, the third monkey eats **21 bananas/day** each day.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{T}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \]

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

answer:  First, convert the height of the first child from feet to inches: \( 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \).

Next, calculate the height of the second child:
- The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
- Therefore, the second child is \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \).

Then, calculate the height of the third child:
- The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
- Therefore, the third child is \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \).

Finally, calculate the height of the fourth child:
- The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
- Therefore, the fourth child is \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \).

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

answer:  Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( T \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat is \( \frac{T}{2} \).
2. The pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so they took \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{4} \).
3. The remaining meat after the velociraptors ate is \( \frac{T}{2} - \frac{T}{4} = \frac{T}{4} \).
4. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so \( \frac{T}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{4} = 270 \]
\[ T = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ T = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

answer:  To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population as \( P \).

Given:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } P = 240 \]

We can write this as:
\[ 0.40P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = P - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

answer:  To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between each train arrival.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives in 30 minutes (half an hour).
   - Stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of 20 minutes).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives in 60 minutes (an hour).
   - Departs immediately after arrival.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives in 80 minutes (20 minutes after the third train).

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time:

- From the first train to the second train: 20 minutes.
- From the second train to the third train: 20 minutes.
- From the third train to the fourth train: 20 minutes.

Total waiting time = 20 minutes + 20 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait 60 minutes for his train.

answer:  To determine the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Revenue from red balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Revenue from blue balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Revenue from green balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
- Total revenue: \( 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \)

Therefore, the store will have received $157 in total after all the balls are sold.

answer:  To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas left.

1. Ellen started with 12 sodas.
2. She shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas.
3. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so there are 12 - 3 - 1 = 8 unshaken sodas left.
4. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas left.

The total number of sodas left is 2 shaken sodas + 6 unshaken sodas = 8 sodas.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Likelihood} = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so the total number of days is:

\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, Billy takes 10 days off. This means he helps people for the remaining days:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. Therefore, in one day, he helps:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Over 40 days, he helps:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

- Breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:

Total time for 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours:

Total time for 5 days = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

answer:  Anna had a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left.

She bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book as \( x \).

The total cost of the two books is \( 2x \).

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left in her budget. Therefore, the total amount she spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

answer:  To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.

1. Calculate the growth rate per year:
   \[
   \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
   \]

2. Calculate the total growth over 13 years:
   \[
   \text{Total growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

answer:  Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the new balance is:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

So the discounted price of the frying pan is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

Adding the discounted prices of the frying pan and the towels to her current balance:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $3.00 = $89.00

Sheila's new balance is $89.00.

answer:  To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and then sum these times.

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog. Therefore, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.
3. Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry. Since Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 8 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

\[ \text{Length of each part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, each of these 25 centimeters needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

\[ \text{Length of each smaller part} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

answer:  First, determine the height from which the ball is initially dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = \frac{144}{3} \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate the height after the second bounce. The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = \frac{96}{3} \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

answer:  To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to determine the weight of each dog and then sum them up.

1. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
2. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}

1. Peter wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
   \[
   \text{Peter's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:
   \[
   \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of apples taken by Peter and Paul:
\[
\text{Total taken by Peter and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount taken by Peter and Paul from the original amount:
\[
\text{Amount left} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north wall: 10 feet x 8 feet = 80 square feet
- The south wall: 10 feet x 8 feet = 80 square feet
- The east wall: 5 feet x 8 feet = 40 square feet
- The west wall: 5 feet x 8 feet = 40 square feet

Next, let's find the total area of all four walls:

Total area = 80 square feet + 80 square feet + 40 square feet + 40 square feet = 240 square feet

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required to cover 240 square feet. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet:

Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

Total cost = 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144

So, it will cost \boxed{144} dollars to paint the room.

answer:  June has 30 days, and Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in total. She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

First, let's calculate how many miles she plans to hike in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ hikes/day} \times 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach 9,300 miles:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate how many more miles per day she needs to hike:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

answer:  To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Speed of the average car:**
   The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Speed of the fastest car:**
   The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600
   \]

4. **Calculate the speed of the fastest car:**
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, the fastest car goes at a speed of 750 miles per hour.

He saved $11 from his allowance, so he now has $21 + $11 = $<<21+11=32>>32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so he now has $32 - $5 = $<<32-5=27>>27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so he now has $27 - $19 = $<<27-19=8>>8 left.

answer:  To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate the 20% increase in enrollment from last year and add it to the original number of students.

1. Calculate 20% of 50:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. Add this increase to the original number of students:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60
   \]

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class.

answer:  To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of people from the cars:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people from the cars is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of people from the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people from the buses is \( 12 \times 35 = 420 \).

Now, we add the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses to find the total number of people inside the church:
- Total people from cars: 60
- Total people from buses: 420
- Total people inside the church: \( 60 + 420 = 480 \)

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 480.

answer:  First, determine the length of the tree that John can cut into logs:
\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate how many 4-foot logs can be made from the 64 feet of wood:
\[ 64 \text{ feet} \div 4 \text{ feet/log} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Each log is cut into 5 planks:
\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2:
\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes $96.

answer:  To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each type of tree and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 trees that each have 7 blue birds:
   \[
   3 \text{ trees} \times 7 \text{ blue birds/tree} = 21 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

2. For the 2 trees that each have 4 blue birds:
   \[
   2 \text{ trees} \times 4 \text{ blue birds/tree} = 8 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

3. For the 1 tree that has 3 blue birds:
   \[
   1 \text{ tree} \times 3 \text{ blue birds/tree} = 3 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds:
\[
21 \text{ blue birds} + 8 \text{ blue birds} + 3 \text{ blue birds} = 32 \text{ blue birds}
\]

The final answer is 32.

answer:  First, let's determine the initial number of male and female fish:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's account for the fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchases:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Finally, let's find the difference between the number of female and male fish:

- Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16
- Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11

The difference is 16 - 11 = 5 more female fish.

answer:  First, we need to determine the distance to John's parents' house. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a month:

\[ \text{Total distance per month} = \text{Distance per trip} \times \text{Number of trips per month} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 140 \, \text{miles/trip} \times 2 \, \text{trips/month} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 280 \, \text{miles/month} \]

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

answer:  To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Micah ran.
2. Subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find the distance Ahito ran.

First, let's calculate the distance Micah ran:
Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's find the total distance run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total distance run by Amber and Micah} = \text{Distance Amber ran} + \text{Distance Micah ran} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Now, subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find the distance Ahito ran:
\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs would cost:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $40 is:

\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, let's determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

Therefore, each single bagel will cost $1.00 after ordering 4 packs and receiving the 10% discount.

answer:  Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
She plans to live with 40% of her current salary, which is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.
She wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, so she needs to save $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 in total.
Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, so she saves 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.
To save $800,000, she needs to work for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.
Since she has already worked for 20 years, she needs to work for an additional 40 - 20 = 20 years.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers, which is \( \frac{S}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which is \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers in the beginning.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during the 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so they produce a total of 6 toys/hour * 2 workers * 10 hours = 120 toys.

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so they produce a total of 4 toys/hour * 2 workers * 10 hours = 80 toys.

Together, the first four workers produce 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

The total number of toys needed for the order is 400, and the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must produce 400 toys - 20 toys = 280 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we can find their production rate by dividing the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked:

280 toys / 10 hours = 28 toys per hour.

answer:  Let's denote Vince's current age as \( V \).

Liam is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, Liam was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve for \( V \):

\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

answer:  To find the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Determine the total number of women.
3. Divide the total height by the total number of women to get the average.

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels:
   - Three women wearing 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
   - Three women wearing 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches
   - Total height: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

2. Determine the total number of women:
   - Three women wearing 4-inch heels
   - Three women wearing 2-inch heels
   - Total number of women: \(3 + 3 = 6\)

3. Divide the total height by the total number of women to get the average:
   - Average height: \(\frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ women}} = 3 \text{ inches}\)

Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is \boxed{3} inches.

answer:  To determine how many lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade.

First, let's find the number of lemons Tim collects in one year:
- Tim grows 5 trees.
- Each tree produces 6 lemons per year.

So, the number of lemons collected in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade:
- A decade is 10 years.

So, the number of lemons collected in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the Earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, we know the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]

answer:  If Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns, then her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10000 per month.
The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.
Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15000 = $30000 per month.
The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 per month.

- For large-sized picture scenes:
  \[
  \text{Number of days} = \frac{45 \text{ large scenes}}{5 \text{ large scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

- For medium-sized picture scenes:
  \[
  \text{Number of days} = \frac{36 \text{ medium scenes}}{6 \text{ medium scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

- For small-sized picture scenes:
  \[
  \text{Number of days} = \frac{49 \text{ small scenes}}{7 \text{ small scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, add the number of days for each type to find the total number of days required:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, it will take Lauren a total of 22 days to create all of the picture scenes.

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce per crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces per box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes together is 25 pounds.

answer:  Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

answer:  To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance Sid traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- He then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Sid took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles.
- He took 3 hours to travel the additional 140 miles.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour.

answer:  To determine how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} \approx 9.01 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take approximately 9.01 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28:
\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

answer:  To find the total duration of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song.

First, calculate 60% of the first song's length:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add this to the length of the first song to find the total length of the second song:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add the lengths of both songs to find the total duration of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is 13 minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops} \]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are in one scoop of mashed potatoes.

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes} \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops} \]

So, the number of potatoes per scoop is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:
\[ 18 \text{ scoops} \times 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} = 27 \text{ potatoes} \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

answer:  To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days.
2. Use the information that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian to find out how far Brian will walk.

First, let's calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days:
Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) be the distance Brian will walk in seven days. According to the problem, Sofie's distance is twice Brian's distance:
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added over three weeks:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.
- Number of cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added over three weeks:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.
- Number of chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows = 50
- Initial number of chickens = 20

Total number of animals = 50 cows + 20 chickens + 420 cows + 210 chickens = 700 animals.

Next, determine the total number of M&Ms in the large bags:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, calculate how many small bags John can make if each small bag contains 10 M&Ms:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

To find the number of passengers per part, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

So, each part of the ratio represents 6 passengers.

The number of men is 5 parts:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

The number of women is 9 parts:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Initially, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus.

Next, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]

- 3/4 of the octuplets are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of the octuplets are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies wearing bows:

- All 2 babies dressed in blue wear bows.
- 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

- The number of babies wearing bows who are wearing purple is 2.
- The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.

The percentage chance is:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

The answer is 50%.

1. Identify the number of green jelly beans.
2. Calculate the number of red jelly beans.
3. Determine the total number of green and red jelly beans.
4. Subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans to find the number of blue jelly beans.

1. The number of green jelly beans is given as 17.
2. The number of red jelly beans is twice the number of green jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of green and red jelly beans is:
   \[
   17 + 34 = 51
   \]
4. The total number of jelly beans is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:
   \[
   60 - 51 = 9
   \]

Therefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans.

answer:  Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \), the number of eggs painted by Camden as \( C \), and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + A + C + S = 56 \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)
3. \( C = S + 12 \)

Substituting the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, using the third equation:
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
\[ A = 9 \]

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 9 = 12 \]

So, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

answer:  To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in one day.
2. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days.

First, let's find out how many face masks Tyrion uses in one day:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- He goes out three times a day.

So, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ masks per outing} \times 3 \text{ outings per day} = 6 \text{ masks per day} \]

Next, let's find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- He uses 6 face masks per day.
- There are 2 days.

So, the number of face masks he uses in 2 days is:
\[ 6 \text{ masks per day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Finally, calculate the loss:
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Adam loses $16 from his investment.

answer:  To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

1. The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.20.
2. The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Now, we multiply these probabilities together:

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - She spends 40 minutes on the beach.

2. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
   - Since she spends 40 minutes on the beach, and she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is half of the time spent on the beach.
   - Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total time for the walk:**
   - Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time spent on the sidewalk: 20 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes

#### 60 minutes

answer:  Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which is $40. Therefore, his profit per device is $40 - $20 = $20.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so his profit from Monday is:
\[ 2 \text{ devices} \times \$20 \text{ per device} = \$40 \]

Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so his profit from Tuesday is:
\[ 4 \text{ devices} \times \$20 \text{ per device} = \$80 \]

The total profit from selling all the devices is:
\[ \$40 + \$80 = \$120 \]

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ 3160 \]

answer:  To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
\[ 5 \text{ weekdays} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).
- Mason eats 5 carrots each weekend day.
\[ 2 \text{ weekend days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of carrots eaten in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

answer:  Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle becomes 33 degrees.

He then pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into the bottle, so the new temperature of the water in the bottle becomes \( 33 + T \) degrees.

Since Donny can only drink water that is at least 40 degrees, we set up the inequality:

\[ 33 + T \geq 40 \]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \) of the second mug, we solve the inequality:

\[ T \geq 40 - 33 \]

\[ T \geq 7 \]

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 7 degrees.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Next, let's calculate the number of goals scored by each team in the second half:
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores (1/4) * 2 = 1 goal.
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's sum up the total number of goals scored by both teams:
- Total goals scored by team A: 4 (first half) + 1 (second half) = 5 goals.
- Total goals scored by team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 5 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 15 goals.

answer:  To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of reports received last week.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total reports received last week: 5168
2. Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
3. Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Next, subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining total:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.

answer:  To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, each bottle covers 0.20 of one person's daily energy demand.

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 0.20 \text{ bottles/person} = 4600 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the number of bottles they currently produce from the total number of bottles required:
\[ 4600 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 400 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 400 more bottles of juice to be able to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total number of eggs eaten in 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 240 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

answer:  To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist.
2. Determine the total number of teeth James has.
3. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed.

First, let's find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:
- The dentist drills 4 teeth.
- The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drilled, so he caps \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) teeth.

Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is \( 4 + 11 = 15 \).

Next, we know that James has 30 teeth in total.

Now, we calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

Next, determine the number of eggs found by each person:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy: \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) eggs.

Now, add up the total number of eggs found:
\[ 5 \text{ (Lamar)} + 10 \text{ (Stacy)} + 8 \text{ (Charlie)} + 4 \text{ (Mei)} = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

answer:  To determine Geb's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Haley's age.
2. Calculate half of Haley's age.
3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Haley's age is 26 years old.
2. Half of Haley's age is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).
3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age: \( 13 - 10 = 3 \).

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

answer:  First, determine the number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, determine the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day.
- Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Now, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Number of sunflowers from bouquets sold per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.
- Total number of sunflowers sold per day = 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

The combined length of all three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + (B + 7) + 4B = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

answer:  To find the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the production for each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
5. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced in each year:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2 + 5 = 7

3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 7 + 6 = 13

4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.
   - Apples on the ground: 0

Now, let's add up all the apples Newton brought home:
- Apples on the ground: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13
- Apples in his pocket: 1

So, Newton brought home a total of 13 + 1 = 14 apples.

answer:  To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts over the five days, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the number of puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 \]

Therefore, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds.

answer:  To determine how much Jen spends on food in the month of May, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in May.
2. Determine the daily food cost for one fish.
3. Calculate the daily food cost for all three fish.
4. Multiply the daily food cost by the number of days in May to get the monthly cost.

1. May has 31 days.
2. Each fish needs $1 worth of food a day.
3. Jen has 3 fish, so the daily food cost for all three fish is:
   \[
   3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day}
   \]
4. To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily food cost by the number of days in May:
   \[
   \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93 \text{ per month}
   \]

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her 3 fish in the month of May.

answer:  Let \( R \) represent the amount of red paint used in pints. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, each of these colors also uses \( R \) pints.

Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is \( \frac{R}{2} \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + R + R + \frac{R}{2} = 12 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3R + \frac{R}{2} = 12 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6R + R = 24 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 7R = 24 \]

Solve for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{24}{7} \]
\[ R = 3.42857 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is approximately \( 3.42857 \) pints.

answer:  Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as \( C \).

According to the problem, Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]
seashells.

Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:
\[ C = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]
seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by all three:
\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:
\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's calculate how much chalk is left after Monday:

\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Now, let's determine how many days the remaining chalk will last:

\[ \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ inch/day}} = 2.75 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2.75 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

answer:  Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, so in 60 minutes, he can build 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball.
However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, 2/15 = 2/3 of a snowball will melt.
Therefore, in 60 minutes, Jay will have 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 of a snowball, which means he will lose 1/3 of a snowball every 60 minutes.
To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many 60-minute intervals it will take for him to lose 60 snowballs.
Since Jay loses 1/3 of a snowball every 60 minutes, it will take him 60 / (1/3) = 180 60-minute intervals to lose 60 snowballs.
Therefore, it will take Jay 180 * 60 = 1800 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

answer:  To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Ned's height.
2. Determine Carl's height based on Ned's height.
3. Calculate the length of Carl's cane based on Carl's height.

1. **Find Ned's height:**
   - Isabel is 7 feet tall.
   - Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.
   - Therefore, Ned's height is \( 7 - 2 = 5 \) feet.

2. **Determine Carl's height:**
   - Carl is one foot taller than Ned.
   - Therefore, Carl's height is \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) feet.

3. **Calculate the length of Carl's cane:**
   - Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
   - Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) feet.

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

answer:  First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially has:
\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
So, he uses 20 bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ bills} \]

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill is equivalent to 2 5 dollar bills:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ 5 dollar bills} \]

So, Thomas has:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

answer:  To determine how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the amount of sour milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:
\[ \text{Amount of sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the amount of sour milk:
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of \$5600 from the company.

answer:  To determine the total cost of May's haircut and coloring, we need to calculate both the cost of the haircut and the cost of the coloring.

1. **Cost of the haircut:**
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.
   - The reduction in hair length is \( 10 - 8 = 2 \) inches.
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the coloring:**
   - The cost of the coloring is $40.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the coloring.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 60 + 40 = 100 \) dollars.

answer:  Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold this 40 square meters for $50. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold these 20 square meters for $30. The remaining land is:

\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:

\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Ali's order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags Ali needs.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, let's find out how many 50 kg bags are needed for 850 kg of coal:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per bag}} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} \]

\[ \text{Number of bags} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306.

answer:  To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at each time.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that entered in the morning came in, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add up all these numbers:

\[ 50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (at 10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after a while)} + 150 \text{ (by evening)} = 320 \]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

answer:  To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find the number of books per school.

First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the cost per book:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

answer:  To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
2. Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
3. Calculate Jim's current age based on the information given.

First, we know that Digimon came out 20 years ago. Therefore, John's age when Digimon came out was:
\[ 28 - 20 = 8 \]

Next, we know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out. According to the problem:
\[ 8 = 2J \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

Finally, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age when Digimon came out:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The answer is:
\[ 24 \]

answer:  First, let's determine the number of apartments in each complex:

- The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so the total is \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
- The last complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined, so it has \(400 + 0.6 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects a total of:
\[ 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so his total earnings per week are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

Now, we add the miles from all the days:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
   - His children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons.

4. **Fourth Day:**
   - There are 3 people at the party.
   - The remaining root beer is shared equally among the 3 people.
   - Each person gets: \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \) gallons.

So, each person gets approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is approximately 2.67 gallons.

**Answer:** 2.67 gallons

answer:  First, calculate Jen's weekly earnings:
- She works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Weekly earnings:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$135/\text{week} \]

Next, add the additional $10 for complete attendance:
\[ \$135/\text{week} + \$10 = \$145/\text{week} \]

Now, calculate her total earnings for April:
- April has 4 weeks.

Total earnings for April:
\[ \$145/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$580 \]

Therefore, Jen will receive $580 for April.

answer:  Let's denote the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day as \( x \).

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages left.

On the second day, they used 30 bandages, so they had \( x + 12 - 30 = x - 18 \) bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) bandages. So, they had \( x - 18 - 25 = x - 43 \) bandages left.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore:
\[ x - 43 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 + 43 \]
\[ x = 121 \]

The nurses started with 121 bandages on the first day.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Rissa was given as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Let's denote the amount of money Rissa gave to her sister as \( x \). Therefore:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister.

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his little sister.

Therefore, the amount of money Ronnie has left is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]

answer:  Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. Therefore, the height of the house is:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} \]
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is \( 240 \) inches.

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then sum them up.

1. **Red pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
     \[
     5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ red pens}
     \]

2. **Black pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.
   - Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is:
     \[
     2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ black pens}
     \]

3. **Total number of pens:**
   - Add the number of red pens and black pens:
     \[
     25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
     \]

So, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

answer:  To determine the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the amount of blood one shark has.
2. Multiply the amount of blood one shark has by the number of sharks.

First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Therefore, we calculate the amount of blood one shark has as follows:

\[ \text{Blood of one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood of one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of blood for ten sharks. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood one shark has by the number of sharks:

\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = \text{Blood of one shark} \times \text{Number of sharks} = 120 \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200.

answer:  To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of all three tunas.
2. Multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram to find the total earnings.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Next, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
- Price per kilogram is $0.50.

Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

So, the special size box has 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods.

Next, we need to find the cost per pod for the special size box. The special size box costs $12, and it contains 120 pods.

Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Now, we need to determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1. Since each cycle uses 1 pod and each pod costs $0.10, we can calculate the number of cycles by dividing $1 by $0.10.

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10 per cycle = 10 cycles

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the special size box for $1.

answer:  Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), follow these steps:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

   \text{Total medicine per dosage} = 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
   \[
   \text{Total medicine in 8 doses} = 56 \text{ mL/dose} \times 8 \text{ doses} = 448 \text{ mL}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \(448 \text{ mL} \).

answer:  On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.
So, on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees.
The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

answer:  First, calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells} \]

Next, determine the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their shells:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells} \]

Then, calculate the number of shells found by team The finders:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Now, determine the number of shells remaining after team The finders found their shells:
\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells} \]

Finally, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells:
\[ 168 \text{ shells} \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Therefore:

answer:  Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \).

According to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. Seven years from now, Colin will be \( C + 7 \). Therefore, Wendy's current age is \( 5(C + 7) \).

In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \). At that time, he will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

answer:  To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price:
Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume = length * width * height = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

Next, let's calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
Number of jelly beans = Volume / Volume of one jelly bean = 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 3600 jelly beans

Now, let's consider the packing efficiency:
Effective number of jelly beans = Number of jelly beans * Efficiency = 3600 jelly beans * 0.80 = 2880 jelly beans

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = Effective number of jelly beans * Percentage of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 jelly beans

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was:
Difference = True number - Estimated number = 900 jelly beans - 864 jelly beans = 36

answer:  Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so she had:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so she had:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

The total number of eyeshadow colors she had is:
\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she now has:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

The number of colors left in that makeup set is:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ colors} \]

The total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, Amy has:
\[ 7 \text{ eyeshadow colors} \]

answer:  To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each wooden table costs $20.
- Total cost of wooden tables = 4 tables * $20 per table = $<<4*20=80>>80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Total cost of roof frames = 2 frames * $10 per frame = $<<2*10=20>>20.

Now, we add the total cost of the wooden tables and the total cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Total cost of wooden tables + Total cost of roof frames
- Total cost = $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100.

answer:  To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes and then add it to the capacity of Ali's class.

1. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
2. Each of John's classes has a capacity that is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity.

First, calculate the capacity of one of John's classes:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is \( \boxed{150} \).

answer:  First, calculate the amount of the loan John gets. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[ \text{Loan} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan:

\[ \text{Amount used for debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Now, calculate how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Total cheese slices needed = 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 36 slices.

- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Total pepperoni slices needed = 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 24 slices.

Total slices needed = 36 slices + 24 slices = 60 slices.

Next, let's determine how many pizzas are needed:

- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Total number of pizzas needed = Number of cheese pizzas + Number of pepperoni pizzas = 3 pizzas + 3 pizzas = 6 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas.

answer:  To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break down the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. Calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - The cost per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:

answer:  Jolene and her friends filled 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons they had is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, they threw 288 balloons.

answer:  On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60 people.
On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus, so 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus.
The total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = 90 people.
At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so 90 * 2 = 180 people entered the bus.
The total number of people on the bus after the third station is 90 + 180 = 270 people.
The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of remaining spaces on the bus is 270 - 200 = 70 spaces.
To fill the remaining spaces, we need 70 more people.
Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 70 people.
The calculated answer is 70

answer:  To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each type of magazine and then sum them up.

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

Since each issue corresponds to one magazine, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is equal to the total number of issues:
\[
66 \text{ magazines}
\]

Therefore, Susan gets a total of 66 magazines every year.

answer:  To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children.
2. Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes.
3. Subtract the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many diapers Jordan changes.

First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children:
- Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
- There are 2 children.
- Total diaper changes = 5 diaper changes/child * 2 children = 10 diaper changes.

Next, let's determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes:
- Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
- Diapers Jordan's wife changes = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

Finally, we subtract the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many diapers Jordan changes:
- Diapers Jordan changes = 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

answer:  First, let's calculate Jason's weekly earnings for each task:

- Emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 per time = $3.00
- Doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 per time = $3.00
- Taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 per time = $1.50
- Cleaning his room: 1 time * $1.50 per time = $1.50

Now, let's sum up his weekly earnings:

- Emptying the dishwasher: $3.00
- Doing laundry: $3.00
- Taking the trash out: $1.50
- Cleaning his room: $1.50

Total weekly earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Since Jason worked over a two-week period, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

Total earnings for 2 weeks = $8.00 * 2 = $16.00

Jason earned $16.00

answer:  Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is cut into two pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the length of the shorter piece, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ \text{Length of the longer piece} = 4x = 4 \times 8 \]

\[ \text{Length of the longer piece} = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

answer:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600/10 = $<<600/10=60>>60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90.

The total cost for the scotch is 10 bottles * $60 per bottle = $600.

The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is $600 + $1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400.

So, John spends $2400 on everything.

answer:  To determine how long it will take for all students to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students are needed to accommodate all the students.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

1. **Total number of students:**
   - There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (grades 4-7).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students.

2. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Each group consists of 8 students.
   - Number of groups = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

3. **Total time required:**
   - Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room.
   - Total time = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he has traveled:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining fish after accounting for the ones with red stripes:

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:

\[ \text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, there are 42 fish with either red or blue stripes.

answer:  To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the original number of pomelos Eve had.
2. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve has left after giving some away.
3. Subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number of pomelos to find out how many she gave away.

1. Eve originally had 20 pomelos.
2. After giving some away, she is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her original pomelos. Therefore, the number of pomelos she has left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   So, Eve has 5 pomelos left.
3. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number of pomelos:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is:

\(\boxed{15}\)

answer:  First, let's calculate the total original cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount:

- Basic manicure cost: $35
- Basic pedicure cost: $40
- Total original cost: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art for each of her fingers:

- Nail art cost per nail: $3
- Number of fingers: 10
- Total nail art cost: $3/nail * 10 nails = $30

Finally, we add the nail art cost to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure:

- Total cost after discount: $60
- Total nail art cost: $30
- Total amount paid: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

answer:  To determine the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms.
2. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
3. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.

First, let's calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms:
- Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
- There are 80 classrooms.
- Total time = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes.

Next, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total time in hours = 1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours.

Now, calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms:
- The custodian works an 8-hour day.
- Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours/day) * 100% = 250%

So, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning the classrooms.

The answer is 250%.

answer:  To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total amount of exercise required by all four dogs and then use the average to find the unknown.

The total amount of exercise needed by the first three dogs is:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average amount of exercise needed by the four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total amount of exercise needed by all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of miles the last dog needs to walk. The total amount of exercise needed by all four dogs is the sum of the exercise needed by the first three dogs and the last dog:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 - 8 = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. So, her brother used \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.
3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes.

First, let's calculate the total number of grapes used for the pies:
\[ 4 \text{ pies} \times 12 \text{ grapes per pie} = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 \text{ grapes} + 30 \text{ grapes} = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Finally, we add the grapes used for the pies to find the total number of grapes at the beginning:
\[ 36 \text{ grapes} + 48 \text{ grapes} = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

answer:  To determine the cost per stick of jerky, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the bag.
2. Determine the cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the bag.**

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount.
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost per stick.**

The bag contains 30 sticks.
\[ \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

**Step 3: Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.**

Since 1 dollar = 100 cents,
\[ \text{Cost per stick in cents} = 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs \boxed{50} cents.

\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from the standard rate lessons. Charlie gives 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total earnings from the veteran lessons. Charlie gives 2 1-hour lessons at his reduced rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from veteran lessons} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total earnings for the day:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Charlie will make \( \boxed{440} \) for the day.

answer:  To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each speed and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Ran for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Ran for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Ran for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed from all settings:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier is 29 liters.

answer:  First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:
- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookshelf:
- Two middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total capacity of one bookshelf:
\[ 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookshelf:
\[ \frac{110}{55} \approx 2.09 \]

Since Elly cannot have a fraction of a bookshelf, she needs 3 bookcases.

answer:  Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to repay is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount after 11 months is:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles.

2. **Marbles dropped**: He drops half of his marbles. Since he had 10 marbles, he drops:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ marbles}
   \]
   So, after dropping half, he has:
   \[
   10 - 5 = 5 \text{ marbles}
   \]

3. **Marbles picked up**: He then picks up 3 more marbles. Adding these to the remaining 5 marbles:
   \[
   5 + 3 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Marbles thrown away**: One of the 3 marbles he picked up was actually a bead, not a marble. So, he gets rid of this bead:
   \[
   8 - 1 = 7 \text{ marbles}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Brendan ends up with is:
\[
7 \text{ marbles}
\]

answer:  To determine how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to use the information given:

- Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
- This is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

\( \boxed{12} \)

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum them up.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the times for all six sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

answer:  First, let's calculate the number of questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 70 = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

So, Audrey has answered 42 questions correctly on the first test.

Next, let's determine the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to move on to the 7th grade. She needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To answer 70% of the total questions correctly:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total. She has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test.

answer:  To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to an annual cost.

1. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - Pasta: $1.00 per box
   - Cheddar cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere cheese: Twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\)

   Total weekly cost:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. **Annual Cost Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

   Total annual cost:
   \[
   10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
   \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

answer:  For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum three times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2.

Number of visits in the first 5 years = 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits
Total cost for the first 5 years = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. The new cost of one visit is:

$2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5

Number of visits in the next 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits
Total cost for the next 3 years = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45

To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we add the cost of the first 5 years and the cost of the next 3 years:

Total cost = $30 (first 5 years) + $45 (next 3 years) = $75

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum.

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
   \[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

3. For the remaining plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:
   \[ 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \text{ plants} \]
   \[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add up all the water needed:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

answer:  To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red hats:**
   - Skyler has 100 hats in total.
   - Half of the hats are red.
   - Number of red hats = \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)

2. **Calculate the number of hats remaining after accounting for the red hats:**
   - Total hats = 100
   - Red hats = 50
   - Remaining hats = \( 100 - 50 = 50 \)

3. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**
   - 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   - Number of blue hats = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \)

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   - Remaining hats = 50
   - Blue hats = 30
   - Number of white hats = \( 50 - 30 = 20 \)

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 customer buys a car.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs:
     \[
     15 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ customers per car} = 30 \text{ customers}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs:
     \[
     30 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls per customer} = 750 \text{ calls}
     \]

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed is:
\[
\boxed{750}

answer:  To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of ground beef needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Determine how many tablespoons of seasoning are needed for each pound of ground beef.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs. Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs per pound of ground beef, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

The answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]

answer:  To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in four years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game.

First, let's calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years:
- She plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game:
- She scores 21 points per game.

So, the total number of points is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \( 3360 \text{ points} \).

   Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Number of footballs:**
   Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total number of items:**
   To find the total number of items, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs:
   \[
   20 \text{ (helmets)} + 10 \text{ (robots)} + 40 \text{ (footballs)} = 70
   \]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.

answer:  To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of doughnuts Derrick makes in one day.
2. Determine the number of doughnuts Derrick makes in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

First, let's calculate the number of doughnuts Derrick makes in one day:
- Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- 1 dozen = 12 doughnuts.
- Therefore, 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, let's determine the number of doughnuts Derrick makes in June:
- June has 30 days.
- Number of doughnuts made in June = 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts:
- Each doughnut is sold for $2.
- Total revenue = 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies is \( 3C - 2 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is \( C + (3C - 2) = 4C - 2 \).

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 10 + 2 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

answer:  First, calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish:
\[ 6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:
\[ 6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, find the difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry than it would with the old varnish.

answer:  To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach for the week, we need to calculate the number of people each day and then sum them up.

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
2. On the second day, he saw 20 more people than the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
3. On the third day, he saw twice the number of people as the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.
4. For the remaining four days, he saw an average of 60 people each day, so he saw 60 * 4 = 240 people in total.

Now, we add up the number of people seen each day:

First day: 50 people
Second day: 70 people
Third day: 140 people
Remaining four days: 240 people

Total = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people

Therefore, Conor saw 500 people at the beach that week.

answer:  To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price in December.
2. Calculate the price in January.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December**

The price in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

So, the price in December is $72.

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January**

The price in December was $72. In January, the price decreased by 50%.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is $36.

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is **$36**.

answer:  Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land:
- Distance on land: 100 yards
- Speed on land: 20 yards per minute
- Time to hop = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for him to swim in water:
- Distance in water: 100 yards
- Speed in water: 10 yards per minute
- Time to swim = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Now, we add the time for hopping and swimming to find the total time:
- Total time = Time to hop + Time to swim
- Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home.

answer:  To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by each type of animal and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 2-legged animals.
- Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 4-legged animals.
- Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to find the total number of legs:
- Total legs = 20 (from 2-legged animals) + 60 (from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs.

Therefore, the total number of pairs of legs on the farm is 80.

answer:  To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade uploads in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day:
- Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

So, the number of photos uploaded in one day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos:
- Jade has 210 photos in total.
- She uploads 42 photos each day.

So, the number of days required is:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos.

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

After eating 24 apples, the number of apples left is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples left is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. Therefore, the total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money Walter received is:

\[
\boxed{81} \text{ dollars}

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \).

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones. We know the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the four additional phones:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Finally, the total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones:

\[ 2x + 40 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is $60.

Next, let's determine the number of yellow candies. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, let's find the total number of candies that are either red, orange, or yellow. We add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

\[ \text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

Finally, to find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:

\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43 \]

Therefore, there are 43 candies in the bag.

answer:  To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

So, there were 78 teachers at school that day.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped: \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the last 30 seconds popped: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels.
5. After the heat is turned off, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped: \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kernels.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, Garrett has to eat 210 pieces of popcorn.

answer:  First, let's determine John's speaking speed after training. His starting speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \text{ WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \text{ pages} \times 450 \text{ words/page} = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages of text at his trained speed.

answer:  To determine the force needed to move the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of each child: 75 pounds
4. Total weight of the children: 2 children * 75 pounds/child = 150 pounds

Now, we add all these weights together to find the total weight:

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Total weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. Therefore, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

Force needed = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 16 pounds

So, John needs to apply a force of 16 pounds to push the car.

1. Identify the number of blue blocks.
2. Calculate the number of yellow blocks.
3. Determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
4. Subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks.

1. The number of blue blocks is given as 4.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. The total number of blue and yellow blocks is the sum of the blue and yellow blocks:
   \[
   4 + 8 = 12
   \]
4. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
   \[
   32 - 12 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\).

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00.

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs:
- Each dozen contains 12 eggs.
- Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
- To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
  60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets.
- Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

So, Rose's profit will be $8.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for each type of dog:

- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds, so the total daily consumption is:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs, so the total daily consumption is:
  \[
  2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Next, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
\[
15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total weekly consumption. There are 7 days in a week:
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg/week}
\]

Therefore, the Kennel house will need **147 kilograms** of dog food in a week.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for the blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

answer:  To determine the total cost for Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights.
   - Each night costs $80.
   - Total cost for the hotel stay = 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

2. **Cost of the bus trips:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80 = $8.
   - Total cost for the bus trips = 7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

3. **Total cost for the trip:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the hotel stay + Cost of the bus trips
   - Total cost = $240 + $56 = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

\[ \text{Depreciation for the first year} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \]
\[ \text{Value after the first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \]

Next, calculate the depreciation for the second year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the second year} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \]
\[ \text{Value after the second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \]

Finally, calculate the depreciation for the third year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the third year} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \]
\[ \text{Value after the third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528 \]

Therefore, the value of the boat after three years is $3528.

answer:  To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2 \text{ per cupcake} = \$40 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling the cookies:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, add the revenue from the cupcakes and cookies to find the total revenue:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Then, calculate the total cost of the trays:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4 \text{ per tray} = \$20 \]

Finally, subtract the cost of the trays from the total revenue to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

answer:  First, calculate the total number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people, so each person has 1 flashlight.
- There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights.
- Total flashlights = 4 people + 2 flashlights/room * 8 rooms = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, calculate the total number of candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms have 4 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms have 5 medium candles.
- Total candles = (4 rooms * 4 candles/room) + (4 rooms * 5 candles/room) = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Finally, add the total number of flashlights and candles to find the total number of candles and flashlights:
- Total candles and flashlights = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 20 + 36 = 56 candles and flashlights.

answer:  To determine the total cost for the family, we need to calculate the cost of the adult tickets, the cost of the child ticket, and the cost of the popcorns.

1. **Cost of adult tickets:**
   - There are 2 adult tickets (one for each parent).
   - Each adult ticket costs $12.
   - Total cost for adult tickets = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of child ticket:**
   - There is 1 child ticket.
   - Each child ticket costs $8.
   - Total cost for child ticket = \( 1 \times 8 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of popcorns:**
   - They buy 2 popcorns.
   - Each popcorn costs $3.
   - Total cost for popcorns = \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of adult tickets + Cost of child ticket + Cost of popcorns
- Total cost = 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 dollars.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of hours Tim spends in a 5-day work week:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with one call:
\[ 1800 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

answer:  First, let's determine the ages of the sisters. Since there are 3 sisters and each sister is 16 years old, the total age of the sisters is:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years} \]

Next, we know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of the brothers. There are 2 brothers: one is 12 years old and the other is 24 years old. The total age of the brothers is:

\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years} \]

Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers to find the total age of all the siblings:

\[ 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the total age of all the siblings is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]

answer:  First, we need to find the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells.

Cracked seashells = 67

Good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells
Good seashells = 732 - 67 = 665 good seashells.

Therefore, they found 665 good seashells together.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Children:**
   - There are 5 children chasing the truck at the end of the first street.

2. **On the Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Therefore, the total number of children becomes \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

3. **On the Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - Therefore, the total number of children becomes \(10 \times 3 = 30\).

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children give up and leave the group.
   - Therefore, the number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, there are 25 children now following the truck.

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, determine how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{\text{Timothy's pens}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

answer:  To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks.

First, let's find the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs:
\[ 56 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:
\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks per box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so:
\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars per box} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars.

answer:  First, let's calculate the weekly cost for each type of clothing:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Next, let's sum up the weekly costs for all the items:

Total weekly cost = $25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:

Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00 per week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

answer:  First, calculate the total time Charisma spends meditating each day:
- She meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so \(15 \times 2 = 30\) minutes per day.

Next, calculate the total time she spends practicing yoga each week:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour each day, which is \(1 \times 60 = 60\) minutes per day.
- She practices yoga 5 days a week, so \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes per week.

Now, calculate the total time she spends on meditation and yoga each week:
- Meditation: 30 minutes per week
- Yoga: 300 minutes per week
- Total time per week: \(30 + 300 = 330\) minutes

Finally, calculate the total time she spends on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks:
- Total time per week: 330 minutes
- Number of weeks: 4
- Total time in 4 weeks: \(330 \times 4 = 1320\) minutes

Answer: 1320 minutes.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his chores. He earns $6 each week and did chores for 3 weeks:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how much he spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is a total of 4 people. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream cones:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \frac{13}{6.50} \approx 2.0769 \]

Since Ryan cannot buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 2 movie tickets.

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

answer:  To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. **Quarter**:
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - James finds 1 quarter.
   - Total value of the quarter = 25 cents.

2. **Nickels**:
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - James finds 2 nickels.
   - Total value of the nickels = 2 * 5 = 10 cents.

3. **Dimes**:
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.
   - James finds 7 dimes.
   - Total value of the dimes = 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Now, add up the values of all the coins:
- Value of the quarter: 25 cents
- Value of the nickels: 10 cents
- Value of the dimes: 70 cents

Total value = 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

Therefore, James has 105 cents.

answer:  To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Albert's height.
2. Determine Anne's height based on Albert's height.
3. Calculate Jackie's current height based on the information given.
4. Subtract the growth over the summer from Jackie's current height to find her height before the summer.

1. Albert's height is given as 36 inches.
2. Anne's height is twice Albert's height:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Jackie is currently 2 inches shorter than Anne:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's current height} = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height before the summer} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for 2 people, so $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, let's find out how much money Janet had left:

- Amount given by parents: $40
- Amount spent: $27.00

Amount left = $40 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 4 gallons will require:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, for 4 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need:

\[ 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Now, Tim also needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade for Allen. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, an additional gallon will require:

\[ 1 \text{ gallon} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 6 \text{ lemons} \]

To find the total number of lemons needed, we add the lemons required for the additional gallon:

\[ 24 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

answer:  First, calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:
\[ 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ seeds/dozen} = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 \text{ seeds} = 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:
\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, add the number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers to find the total number of seeds:
\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 54 \text{ seeds} = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
\[ 90 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:

\[ \text{Total holes} = 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine how many holes Nate can fill in per day:

\[ \text{Holes per day} = 9 \text{ holes/day} \]

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes Nate fills in each day is:

\[ \text{Net holes per day} = 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, let's find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since 28 days is equal to 4 weeks, it will take Nate **4 weeks** to fill in all the holes.

answer:  To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point:
- Distance = √((Distance west)^2 + (Distance east)^2)
- Distance = √(90^2 + 144^2)
- Distance = √(8100 + 20736)
- Distance = √28836

Calculate the square root:
- Distance ≈ 170 miles

Therefore, Elvis is approximately 170 miles from his house.

answer:  Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he only pays for one T-shirt at the full price and the second T-shirt at half price. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

The cost for the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost for the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.40 = $16.

So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

answer:  To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Calculate the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings for 2 weeks.

1. There are 7 days in a week, and Josh is closed on Sunday and Wednesday. Therefore, he is open for 7 - 2 = 5 days in a week.

2. Josh services 3 cars each day. So, in a week, he services 3 cars/day * 5 days = 15 cars.

3. Josh gets paid $4 per car. Therefore, his weekly earnings are 15 cars * $4/car = $60.

4. To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

answer:  To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.
2. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.

First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is \( 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws per table} \).

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is \( \boxed{8} \).

- Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $<<32*0.25=8.00>>8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10/dime = $<<95*0.10=9.50>>9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $<<120*0.05=6.00>>6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $<<750*0.01=7.50>>7.50

Next, add the values of all the coins to find the total dollar amount:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $<<8+9.5+6+7.5=31.00>>31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00.

answer:  To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any.
2. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas currently has from the total number of marbles he had before dropping any to find out how many marbles he received.
3. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had to find out how many marbles Darla received.

First, we know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. Therefore, the total number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any is:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles and gave them to both Dallas and Darla. So, the total number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas and Darla is:
\[ 52 \]

Since Dallas received 25 marbles, the number of marbles Darla received is:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

The answer is:
\[ 27 \]

answer:  To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.

First, let's find the average enrollment at Butler High School:
- Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.
- Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School.

So, the average enrollment at Butler High School is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \text{ students}
\]

Next, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:
\[
4000 \text{ students} - 3000 \text{ students} = 1000 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

\(\boxed{1000}\)

answer:  To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the docks.
2. Subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total amount required.

First, let's calculate the total amount of line required:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.

So, the total amount of line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total amount required:
- The caretaker already has 6 feet of line.

So, the additional line needed is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line required} - 6 \text{ feet of line he has} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

answer:  Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of his collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, let's determine how many toy soldiers are in each group:
- Half of the collection: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers
- The other half: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each group:
- Earnings from the first group: \( 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$5 \text{ per toy} = \$30 \)
- Earnings from the second group: \( 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$7 \text{ per toy} = \$42 \)

Finally, we add the earnings from both groups to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
- Total earnings: \( \$30 + \$42 = \$72 \)

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $72.

1. Calculate Emma's age:
   \[
   \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16
   \]
   \[
   \text{Emma's age} = 40 + 16 = 56
   \]

2. Calculate the sum of their ages:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = 40 + 56 = 96
   \]

3. Calculate the average of their ages:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of ages}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
   \]

The answer is 48.

answer:  To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, Ana can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges in an hour.

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges in an hour.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of test tubes and Petri dishes Igor actually gathered:

- Igor gathered half the number of test tubes as requested:
  \[
  \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes}
  \]

- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested:
  \[
  14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of items Igor had before he lost any:
\[
8 \text{ test tubes} + 7 \text{ beakers} + 16 \text{ Petri dishes} = 31 \text{ items}
\]

Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench, so the number of items he lost is:
\[
31 - 29 = 2 \text{ items}
\]

Since Igor originally had 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - 2 = 5 \text{ beakers}
\]

Therefore, Igor lost \boxed{5} beakers.

answer:  To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue per reservation.
2. Multiply the daily revenue by the number of reservations per night.
3. Multiply the weekly revenue by the number of nights the restaurant is open per week.

First, let's calculate the total revenue per reservation:
- Each reservation consists of 2 meals and 1 bottle of wine.
- The cost of 2 meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- The cost of one bottle of wine is $5.
- Therefore, the total revenue per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- So, the daily revenue is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly revenue:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- So, the weekly revenue is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all five pigs in one day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Since there are five pigs, the total daily consumption is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed in one week (7 days):

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total consumption from the amount ordered:

\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

answer:  To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
- In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
- Therefore, Ana can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
- In one hour, there are 60 minutes.
- Therefore, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

\[ \boxed{5} \]

answer:  First, calculate the discounted price of the radiator:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \text{Original price} \times (1 - \text{Discount rate}) \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 400 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 80 \]

Next, calculate the cost of the installation:
\[ \text{Installation cost} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} \]
\[ \text{Installation cost} = 3 \times 50 \]
\[ \text{Installation cost} = 150 \]

Finally, add the discounted price of the radiator and the installation cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Discounted price} + \text{Installation cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 230 \]

answer:  To determine how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

2. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

3. **Determine the ratio of their speeds:**
   - Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - This means Aaron's speed is half of Vanessa's speed.

4. **Calculate the time Aaron took to complete his part:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to complete her part:**
   - Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, the time it takes for Vanessa to run the same distance will be twice the time it took for Aaron.
   - Therefore, the time Vanessa took is \( 16 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \).

So, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) years old.
2. James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) years old.

Next, let's determine John's current age.

1. John had James when he was 19, so he is currently \( 19 + 18 = 37 \) years old.

Now, let's determine the current age of John's youngest son.

1. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \( 37 - 32 = 5 \) years old.

Finally, let's determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

1. John's youngest son is currently 5 years old, so in 3 years, he will be \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) years old.

Therefore, John's youngest son will be \( 8 \) years old in 3 years.

answer:  To determine how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week.
2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars.

First, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week:
- The company produces 5000 bars per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in one week, the company produces \( 5000 \times 7 = 35000 \) bars.

Next, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks:
- In two weeks, the company produces \( 35000 \times 2 = 70000 \) bars.

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these bars:
- Each bar is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 70000 \times 2 = 140000 \) dollars.

The company will receive $140000.

1. Calculate the total number of slices from all the pizzas.
2. Determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas.
3. Divide the total number of slices by the total number of people.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices:
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- There are 7 pizzas.
- Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.

Next, let's determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas:
- Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 1 + 3 = 4 people.

Finally, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:
- Slices per person = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of each ingredient for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Next, calculate the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 jars * $44/jar = $440

Then, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
- Total revenue for 10 jars = 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue for 10 jars - Total cost for 10 jars
- Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars.

answer:  To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then sum these amounts.

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
   \]
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts raised by all three girls:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} = 430 + 750 + 700 = 1880
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised is $1880.

answer:  To determine the selling price per watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the profit per watermelon.
3. Add the profit to the cost price to get the selling price.

First, let's find the cost price per watermelon:
- The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
- Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
- Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Next, let's calculate the profit per watermelon:
- The profit is 25% of the cost price per watermelon.
- Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
- Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Finally, we add the profit to the cost price to get the selling price:
- Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
- Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows.

We have two equations based on the information given:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now, substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
