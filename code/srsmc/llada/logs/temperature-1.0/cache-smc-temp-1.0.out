answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Half of 2 bolts is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.
So, the total number of bolts used is 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

answer:  James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters each day.

He does this 3 times a week, so he runs 180 * 3 = 540 meters a week.

answer:  To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased value of the house after repairs.
2. Determine the selling price of the house.
3. Subtract the original cost from the selling price to find the profit.

1. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased this value by 150%.
   \[
   \text{Increased value} = 80,000 \times 1.50 = 120,000
   \]

2. The selling price of the house is the increased value plus the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Selling price} = 120,000 + 50,000 = 170,000
   \]

3. The profit is the selling price minus the original cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 170,000 - 80,000 = 90,000
   \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is $90,000.

answer:  To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends.
3. Calculate the number of eggs left for sale.
4. Multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to find the daily earnings.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends. So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.
3. The number of eggs left for sale is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs used, which is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.
4. Janet sells each egg for $2. Therefore, her daily earnings are the number of eggs sold multiplied by the price per egg, which is 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The answer is $18 per day.

answer:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost of the first 8 glasses and the cost of the next 8 glasses separately.

1. **Cost of the first 8 glasses:**
   - Each glass costs $5.
   - Total cost for 8 glasses: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the next 8 glasses:**
   - Every second glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass.
   - Cost of each second glass: \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 8 glasses: \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 16 glasses:**
   - Total cost for the first 8 glasses: $40
   - Total cost for the next 8 glasses: $24
   - Total cost for 16 glasses: \( 40 + 24 = 64 \) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

answer:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file.

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the restart to install updates:

40 minutes (first part) + 60 minutes (second part) + 20 minutes (restart) = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

answer:  To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to calculate the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep from each city:

- Seattle's sheep: 20
- Charleston's sheep: 80
- Toulouse's sheep: 160

Total number of sheep = \( 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \)

Thus, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together.

Answer: \( \boxed{260} \).

answer:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for all the chickens in a day.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens. Therefore, the total amount of feed required in a day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed Wendi has already given in the morning and afternoon meals:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount required to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

answer:  Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours is $10, so she earns 40 * $10 = $<<40*10=400>>400 for the first 40 hours.
Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, so she worked 45 - 40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours of overtime.
Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $<<1.2*10=12>>12 per hour.
Therefore, she earns 5 * $12 = $<<5*12=60>>60 for the overtime hours.
Her total earnings for this week are $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460.

answer:  To find the total cost of Toula's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Cost per dozen: $68
   - Total cost for donuts: \( 3 \times 68 = $204 \)

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Cost per dozen: $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes: \( 2 \times 80 = $160 \)

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Cost per dozen: $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes: \( 6 \times 55 = $330 \)

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Toula's purchases is $694.

answer:  To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times as many as the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \(3 \times 60 = 180\).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - To find 30% of 180, we calculate \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\).
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is \(180 - 54 = 126\).

Now, we sum up the downloads from all three months:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366.

answer:  To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each segment of his trip and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles

Now, we sum the distances from each segment to find the total distance traveled:

Total Distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 80 miles = 275 miles

Therefore, John is 275 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners.

After these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{6} = 6 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 6:
\[ x = 6 \times 6 \]

\[ x = 36 \]

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

answer:  To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential profit from each purchase based on the predicted market increase.

**Jewelry Purchase:**
- Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
- Predicted increase: 2.5%
- Increase in value: $5,000 * 2.5% = $125
- New value: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

**Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
- Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Predicted increase: 1.2%
- Increase in value: $8,000 * 1.2% = $96
- New value: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the jewelry purchase.

Therefore, the maximum profit from the jewelry is $125.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for the contemporary dance students:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Then, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

Now, we calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

Finally, we find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

answer:  To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to compare the initial cost of planting the tree to the annual revenue from selling lemons minus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree.

1. **Initial cost of planting the tree:** $90
2. **Annual revenue from selling lemons:** 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:** $3
4. **Annual profit:** Annual revenue - Annual cost = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take for the annual profit to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the annual profit:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial cost}}{\text{Annual profit}} = \frac{90}{7.5} \]

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from the lemon tree.

answer:  First, calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a teacher:
- Weekly earnings as a teacher = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week

Next, calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a coach:
- Weekly earnings as a coach = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week

Now, calculate her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings as a teacher + Weekly earnings as a coach
- Total weekly earnings = $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week

Finally, calculate her annual salary:
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks in a year
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day:
- Claire eats 3 eggs per day.

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs she eats in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
- She eats 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs eggs

Finally, let's convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine the total distance Marissa has already walked:
- She walked 4 miles in 1 hour.
- She walked 2 miles in 1 hour.

Total distance walked so far = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total time she has spent walking:
- She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour for the next 2 miles.

Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance and the remaining time:
- Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.
- Remaining time = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours.

To achieve the average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 2 hours.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

answer:  To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered on each day.

1. On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.
2. On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, each train covers 230 miles in the two days.

answer:  To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine Raymond's age when he had his son.
3. Calculate the number of years since Raymond's son was born.

1. Samantha's current age is 31.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's current age} = 31 - 6 = 25
   \]
3. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract Raymond's age when he had his son from his current age:
   \[
   \text{Years since Raymond's son was born} = 25 - 23 = 2
   \]

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

1. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD:
   \[

   \]

2. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs:
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

Now, we sum up the DVDs sold to all the customers:
\[
3 \text{ DVDs} + 4 \text{ DVDs} + 0 \text{ DVDs} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

Therefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is:

answer:  First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
\[ 10 \text{ liters} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
\[ 15 \text{ liters} \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's add the water from both drinks:
\[ 6.67 \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, you spilled one liter of the orange drink, so the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ 15.67 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 14.67 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is approximately 14.67 liters.

The answer is 14.67 liters.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered: the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
3. Apples: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

Adding these together:
\[ $12 + $15 + $6 = $33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizzas is:
\[ $50 - $33 = $17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizzas by the cost per box:
\[ $17 \div $8.50 = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Finally, calculate the total cost of the cartons. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

answer:  To find the original price of the book, we need to account for the 25% discount. Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, the price Kyle paid is \( 0.75P \).

We know that Kyle paid $19.50, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 19.50 \times \frac{1}{0.75} = 19.50 \times \frac{4}{3} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

Given:
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
- The total cost of the two pairs of heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
- The total cost of the heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

answer:  To find the average guess, we need to calculate each guess and then find the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend guesses 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, so the third friend guesses 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up the guesses:
- First friend: 80 jelly beans
- Second friend: 60 jelly beans
- Third friend: 100 jelly beans

Total = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 jelly beans

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of friends:
Average = 240 jelly beans / 3 friends = 80 jelly beans

The average guess is 80 jelly beans.

answer:  Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\). According to the problem, their total age now is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:

\[ \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

1. Identify the position of the first stop.
2. Determine the position of the second stop.
3. Calculate the distance between the two stops.

1. The first stop is at mile 20.
2. The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, the second stop is at:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
   \]
3. The distance between the first and second stops is:
   \[
   45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

answer:  Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

answer:  To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, we calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

Next, we add this to the points scored in the first 20 minutes to find the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points by the end of the 40 minutes.

answer:  To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week to get the weekly time.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.**

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Therefore, the total daily time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 2: Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week to get the weekly time.**

There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total weekly time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the number of hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs is \(\boxed{35}\).

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, let's see how much money John has left after buying video games:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is:
\[ \$35 + \$5 = \$40 \]

Since he sells each lego set for $15, we can find out how many lego sets he still has by dividing the total money he has by the price per lego set:
\[ \$40 \div \$15 = 3 \text{ lego sets} \]

Therefore, John still has 3 lego sets.

answer:  Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, so her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she spends (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours running and (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
The distance she travels while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Therefore, the total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of hours John runs in a week.

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
On the second day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
On the third day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance he runs by the total number of hours he runs in a week:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \boxed{10} miles per hour.

answer:  To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Find the difference between the throw distance when holding the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames.

1. Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw the javelin for a distance of \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) feet.
3. The reach of the dragon's flames is 1000 feet.

The difference between the throw distance when holding the gemstone and the reach of the dragon's flames is \( 1200 - 1000 = 200 \) feet.

Answer: 200 feet

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of calories in a 300g bag of chips. Since each serving has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag:

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can consume if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since a 300g bag of chips contains 1250 calories, we can calculate how many grams you can eat to consume 200 calories:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories/gram}} \times 300 \text{ grams} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

answer:  To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of pie Grandma Jones baked.
2. Subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of pie:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 26.

answer:  To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Age of Suzy's iPhone:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Age of Ben's iPhone:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = \( 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \) articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write:
- Total hours spent writing = \( 26 \times 4 = 104 \) hours.

**Answer:** 104 hours

answer:  John spent $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 each. Therefore, he bought:
\[ \frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties} \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties} \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of each red tie is:
\[ 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the blue ties is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the red ties is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[ 200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spent $800 on ties.

answer:  To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had at the beginning.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the total number she had.
3. Add the number of Post-it notes she had remaining to the result to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes to place on the cups of coffee.
3. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

First, calculate the number of Post-it notes she had after using some:
\[ 80 - 220 = -140 \]

Next, add the remaining Post-it notes to this result to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased:
\[ -140 + 23 = 117 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 117.

answer:  To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of supplies.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit.

1. **Total Cost of Supplies:**
   - Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (since 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds).
   - Each pound of beeswax costs $10.00.
   - Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00.

2. **Total Revenue from Selling Candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

3. **Net Profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Charlie's net profit is $20.00.

answer:  To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, let's find the total number of units in the building:
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units:
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Occupied units = (3/4) * 120 units = 90 units.

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
- Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
- Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \boxed{30}.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to travel back over the same distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week:
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total eggs per week = 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs.

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens per week = 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 142 dozens.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Lloyd sells each dozen for $2.
- Revenue from 142 dozens per week = 142 dozens * $2/dozen = $284.

Therefore, Lloyd makes $284 on eggs per week.

The answer is $284.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

answer:  First, let's calculate the revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/tire = $480
- Revenue from truck tires (since no truck tires were repaired): $0
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between the two days.

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on day with higher revenue (Thursday): $520
- Revenue on day with lower revenue (Friday): $480
- Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on the day with higher revenue (Thursday) compared to the day with lower revenue (Friday).

**Answer:** $40

answer:  To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add the number of kittens they adopted from the shelter to the number of kittens their house cats have had.

1. The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the shelter.
2. Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ kittens}
   \]
3. Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add up all the kittens:
\[
7 \text{ (adopted kittens)} + 21 \text{ (Patchy's kittens)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie's kittens)}
\]

Adding these together:
\[
7 + 21 = 28
\]
\[
28 + 12 = 40
\]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[
40 \text{ kittens}
\]

answer:  First, calculate the total weight of the comic books:
\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/comic book} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:
\[ 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ 7.5 \text{ pounds} \div \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound/toy} = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

answer:  To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Subtract this weight from the bridge's weight limit to find the remaining weight capacity.
3. Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

First, we know the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

Next, we subtract this weight from the bridge's weight limit:
\[ 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:
\[ \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes} \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

answer:  To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add the delivery fee, delivery fee, and tip to the original bill.

1. **Calculate the delivery fee:**
   - The delivery fee is 25% of $40.00.
   - Delivery fee = 25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

2. **Add the delivery fee to the original bill:**
   - Original bill: $40.00
   - Delivery fee: $10.00
   - Total after delivery fee: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

3. **Add the delivery fee and the tip:**
   - Delivery fee: $3.00
   - Tip: $4.00
   - Final price: $50.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

answer:  To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie ticket and popcorn and then divide the total amount of money he has by this cost.

The cost of a movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one movie outing is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie outing:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:

- The first half of the year consists of 6 months.
- The monthly charge is $140.
- Total cost for the first half = 6 months * $140/month = $840.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year:

- The second half of the year consists of 6 months.
- The monthly charge is 10% less than the initial $140.
- 10% of $140 is $140 * 0.10 = $14.
- Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126.
- Total cost for the second half = 6 months * $126/month = $756.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:

- Total amount = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half
- Total amount = $840 + $756 = $1596

1. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.
2. **Unripe oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. Since there are 25 oranges in total, 20% of 25 is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.
3. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[

\]

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

answer:  To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension amount for the first 20 years and then the reduced pension for the remaining 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Remaining 10 years:**
   - Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - Total pension for the remaining 10 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $50,000.

3. **Total pension for 30 years:**
   - Total pension = $1,000,000 + $50,000 = $1,050,000.

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $50,000 per year.

answer:  To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
\]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[
595
\]

answer:  First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
- He reads for half as long as he does watching TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week. Since he does this 3 times a week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, let's find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jim spends a total of 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of players and coaches sent per school.

1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Therefore, the total number of players per school is:
   \[
   2 \text{ teams} \times 5 \text{ players/team} = 10 \text{ players}
   \]
4. Each school also has one coach for each team.
5. Therefore, the total number of coaches per school is:
   \[
   2 \text{ teams} \times 1 \text{ coach/team} = 2 \text{ coaches}
   \]
6. The total number of people per school is:
   \[
   10 \text{ players} + 2 \text{ coaches} = 12 \text{ people}
   \]

Since there are four schools, the total number of people sent is:
\[
4 \text{ schools} \times 12 \text{ people/school} = 48 \text{ people}
\]

answer:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Sophia can drive on 4 gallons of gas.
2. Determine the total number of miles Sophia can drive on a full tank of gas.

First, we know that Sophia drives 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on 1 gallon of gas, we divide the total miles by the total gallons:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we know that Sophia's gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:

\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

\[ \boxed{300} \]

answer:  To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we need to add the number of instructions from both recipes.

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.
2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) instructions.

Now, add the number of instructions from both recipes:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

- On weekdays, she teaches 5 classes per day for 5 days: \( 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \)
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes: \( 8 \text{ classes} \)

Total classes in a week: \( 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \)

Next, calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students: \( 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \)

Finally, calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:
- She charges $15.00 per student: \( 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \)

So, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, there are 36 teachers.

answer:  To find the average square footage of a level in a 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. The second level has half the square footage of the top level, so it has a square footage of \( 16 / 2 = 8 \).
3. The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it has a square footage of \( 8 / 2 = 4 \).
4. The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it has a square footage of \( 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now, we sum up the square footage of all four levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

The average square footage of a level is the total square footage divided by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is \( 7.5 \) units.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling brownies.**
Tommy sells 43 brownies, and each brownie is sold for $3.
\[ \text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes.**
Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake, and each slice is sold for $4.
\[ \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.**
Add the revenue from brownies and the revenue from cheesecakes.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from brownies} + \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is \(\boxed{221}\).

answer:  To determine the final cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

1. Calculate the amount of the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 100 \times 0.30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30
   \]

2. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 100 - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 70
   \]

So, the final cost of the grooming after the discount is $70.

answer:  To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much laundry David does.
2. Determine how much laundry Raymond does.
3. Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Given:
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

First, find out how much laundry David does:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sara's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, find out how much laundry Raymond does:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sara's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup per day:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy consumes 2 cups per day:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these together gives the total consumption for the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required. Each bag contains 110 cups:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

answer:  To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, he would need 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, he would need 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Difference in cost = $15 - $9 = $6.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

answer:  To find the total number of thorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns.

First, let's find the total number of roses:
- Dan has 3 rose bushes.
- Each rose bush has 25 roses.

So, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of thorns:
- Each rose has 8 thorns.

So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total.

answer:  First, let's determine how much water each girl received. Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water.

\[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's add the water the boy received. The boy got 6 liters of water.

\[ \text{Total water used} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the original amount of water to find out how much is left:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, there are 10 liters of water left.

answer:  To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.

   - Annual salary = $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200

2. **Annual Increase in Salary:**
   - Annual salary increase = 10% of $7200
   - Increase per year = 0.10 * $7200 = $720

3. **Total Increase Over Three Years:**
   - Total increase = $720/year * 3 years = $2160

4. **New Annual Salary:**
   - New annual salary = $7200 + $2160 = $9360

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be:

answer:  To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacations Gene goes on each year.
3. Calculate the total number of vacations by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year.

First, we find the number of years Gene has been vacationing:
- Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
- He is now 34 years old.
- Number of years = Current age - Starting age = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Next, we determine the number of vacations Gene goes on each year:
- Gene goes on 4 vacations a year.

Now, we calculate the total number of vacations by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year:
- Total number of vacations = Number of years * Number of vacations per year = 11 years * 4 vacations per year = 44 vacations.

Since each vacation corresponds to a quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44.

answer:  Let's denote the number of games lost by the football team as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games won can be represented as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second occurrence.
   - Since the second occurrence lasted 12 times, the third occurrence lasted \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three occurrences:

- First occurrence: 4 rings
- Second occurrence: 12 rings
- Third occurrence: 6 rings

Total rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

answer:  To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   - Cindy has 4 pets.
   - Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   - Therefore, Marcia has \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Marcia has 6 pets.
   - Therefore, Jan has \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) pets.

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Cindy has 4 pets.
   - Marcia has 6 pets.
   - Jan has 18 pets.
   - The total number of pets is \( 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \).

So, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have is 28.

answer:  First, calculate the number of guests who will actually show up. Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't show up.

\[ \text{Number of guests who don't show up} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who will show up is:

\[ \text{Number of guests who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest.

\[ \text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Finally, calculate the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

answer:  Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

answer:  To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the consumption for both the adult and child dinosaurs.

1. **Adult Dinosaurs:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
   - Total consumption for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaurs:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult.
   - Since an adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs, a child dinosaur eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total consumption for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**
   - Total consumption for adults: 200 lbs
   - Total consumption for children: 25 lbs
   - Total potato salad needed: \( 200 + 25 = 225 \) lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 students.

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The total number of students is 200, so the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of girls in Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in Girl Scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the answer is 40.

answer:  To determine how fast Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - To find the improved time, we calculate 10% of Gerald's original time and subtract it from his original time.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.
   - Subtract this from Gerald's original time: \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds.

Therefore, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]

   - James is 10 years old.

2. **Corey's Age:**
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) years old.

3. **Amy's Age:**
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Amy's age is \( 11 - 2 = 9 \) years old.

4. **Jackson's Age:**
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Therefore, Jackson's age is \( 9 - 5 = 4 \) years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

answer:  To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits, and then sum them up.

1. The number of dogs is given as 60.
2. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs. Since there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]
3. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
4. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]
5. The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]

answer:  To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original volume of the sauce before cooking.
2. Determine how many cans of tomatoes Freda used.
3. Calculate the total number of tomatoes used.

1. The final volume of the sauce after cooking is 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume during cooking, the original volume of the sauce before cooking is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. Therefore, the number of cans needed is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes in her recipe.

After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through, so the number of cars left is \( 30 - x \).

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the number of cars left is \( (30 - x) - 20 = 10 - x \).

Then, 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars left is \( (10 - x) - 5 = 5 - x \).

We know that after all these events, there are 0 cars left on the motorway. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 - x = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 5 - x = 0 \]
\[ 5 = x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

answer:  To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to calculate the total time required for the fog bank to cover the 42 miles.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \text{Number of 3-mile segments} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance per segment}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to cover these 14 segments:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of segments} \times \text{Time per segment} = 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

answer:  To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read and then divide that by the number of days he has left.

First, let's find the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Next, we subtract the number of pages he has already read:
- Pages read on Monday: 15 pages

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days

Average pages per day = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day.

answer:  To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]
4. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, we sum up the number of rings from all four friends:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings the doorbell made is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]

answer:  To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption into weekdays and weekends.

**Weekdays:**
- John drinks a glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks a glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks a glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks a glass of water before bed.

So, each weekday, John drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses} \]

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

**Weekends:**
- John does not drink water on weekends.

So, each weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses} \]

There are 2 weekend days in a week, so:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 20 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we need to convert 1.5 hours into minutes:
\[ 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find out how many episodes he watched on Wednesday:
\[ \frac{90}{30} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

answer:  Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]
So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

The number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:
\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Her mom then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]
So, her mom places 250 pieces.

The number of pieces remaining after her mom places her pieces is:
\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500.

answer:  First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the outer dimensions.

The outer dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

Subtracting 2 inches from each dimension:
- Inner length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Inner width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Inner height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
- Inner volume = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
- Inner volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
- Inner volume = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
- Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3
- Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

answer:  First, we need to determine how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the distance she rowed in 64 seconds.

\[
\frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{x \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{64 \times 20}{16} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rowed. Therefore, we need to find out how many liters of water the boat took on for 80 feet.

\[
\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters/foot} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback amount.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback:
- The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
- The person buys 10 gallons.
- Total cost before cashback = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cashback amount:
- The app company offers $0.20 per gallon.
- The person buys 10 gallons.
- Total cashback = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00.

Finally, subtract the total cashback from the total cost:
- Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to make \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

- The roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Total roll-ups for Beatrice = 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- The roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Total roll-ups for Marcell = 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups.

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total roll-ups = 48 roll-ups (Beatrice) + 42 roll-ups (Marcell) = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people:
- Average roll-ups = 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups per person.

So, the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $10/board = $100
- Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16/board = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, let's determine the new price of each board after a 50% increase:

- New price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 * 1.5 = $15
- New price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 * 1.5 = $24

Total revenue from selling all boards:

- Total revenue: 10 boards * $15/board + 5 boards * $24/board = $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

answer:  To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the following:

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. There are 4 teachers sharing the classroom.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, let's calculate the total number of lessons per day for all 4 teachers:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ times per lesson} = 24 \text{ times per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

answer:  Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \). According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so:

\[ 6B = 1800 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( D \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Then:

\[ B = 50D \]

Substituting \( B = 300 \):

\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph at the zoo is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]

answer:  Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write:
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30000 \]

So, Lylah earned $30,000 four years ago.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Lylah's salary remains unchanged at $30,000.

Therefore, the total salary that Adrien and Lylah are receiving four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 30000 = 86000 \]

answer:  To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we first need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

The total number of parts in the ratio is:
\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, which is equivalent to 20 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of parts by the total amount:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, Katy used 7 parts of sugar. To find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar:
\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

answer:  To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of vehicles from the first day.
2. Determine the number of vehicles from the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, calculate the number of vehicles from the first day:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, determine the number of vehicles from the second day. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles from the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Kael brought 10 apples and 4 oranges, for a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits in total.

answer:  To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours, then sum these distances.

1. Distance run in the first 3 hours:
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. Distance run in the remaining 4 hours:
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. Total distance run in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in the first 3 hours + Distance in the remaining 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

answer:  To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
2. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month.

First, let's calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week:
- Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.
- There are 30 sheets of paper in each pad.

So, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month. Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month:
- Miguel uses 60 sheets per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, the number of sheets he uses per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

 Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than Friday, so she slept \( 6 + 1 = 7 \) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours slept each day:
\[ 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 36 \]

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 36 hours throughout the week.

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

1. Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After setting the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the following equation based on the information provided:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]

\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia bought 10 spoons in the package.

answer:  To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamps.
2. Subtract the number of stamped letters from the total number of letters needing stamps to find out how many letters were left unstamped.

First, calculate the number of letters Jennie stamps:
\[ \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Next, subtract the number of stamped letters from the total number of letters needing stamps to find out how many letters were left unstamped:
\[ \text{Number of letters left unstamped} = 60 - 20 = 40 \]

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began is:
\[ \text{Number of letters in the pile when Jennie began} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was 10.

answer:  To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, the number of fish sausages is:
\[ 38 + 6 = 44 \]

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages:
\[ 38 + 44 = 82 \]

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

answer:  To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to determine his expenditure for each month and then add them together.

In May, Joseph's expenditure was $500.

In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June is:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour, so for 0.4 hours, it charges $200 * 0.4 = $80 per patient.
- The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total revenue from patients is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the doctors:
- Each doctor charges $150 per hour, so for 0.4 hours, they charge $150 * 0.4 = $60 per patient.
- The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total cost for doctors is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

Each orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.
Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
The cost of 4 watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.
The cost of 20 peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.
The cost of 10 oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.
The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

1. Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them.
2. Subtract this number from the initial number of elves.
3. Subtract the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining elves.

1. Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them:
   \[
   \text{Number of elves who quit after children vomit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20

   \]

3. Subtract the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining elves:
   \[
   \text{Number of elves left after kids kick their shins} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:

answer:  First, we need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. Brian originally had 20 video games but lost 5:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, Brian has 15 video games after losing 5.

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

2. Determine the total distance Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total distance from Monday and Tuesday from the total distance for Monday through Wednesday to find the distance for Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday:
Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
\[ \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's determine the total distance Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ \text{Total distance on Monday and Tuesday} = 4 + 24 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total distance from Monday and Tuesday from the total distance for Monday through Wednesday to find the distance for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

answer:  To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of car washes Tom gets in a year.
2. Calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year.

First, let's find out how many car washes Tom gets in a year:
- Tom gets 4 car washes a month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of car washes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year:
- Each car wash costs $15.
- Tom gets 48 car washes in a year.

So, the total cost in a year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

answer:  To determine the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the number of pink gumballs as \( P \). According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. We know there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

First, calculate 4 times the number of blue gumballs:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Next, add 22 to this result:

\[ P = 48 + 22 \]

\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

answer:  Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each, so the cost for the subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.
She orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, so the cost for the chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
She orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so the cost for the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.
There is a 20% delivery fee added, so the delivery fee is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.
She wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the total cost of the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.
Therefore, the total cost of her delivery order is $29.00.

\[ \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we need to calculate the tax amount. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the total cost before tax by 10% (or 0.10):

Tax amount = $15 * 0.10 = $1.50

Finally, we add the tax amount to the total cost before tax to find the total cost including tax:

Total cost including tax = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

So, the total cost of everything, including tax, is $16.50.

answer:  Let's denote the number of queen bees as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Also, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queen bees. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \), and the number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:
\[
\boxed{400}

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Next, calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

answer:  To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples in the field.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
- John has 10 hectares of land.
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
- Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples per hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Next, we determine how many harvests John can make in a year:
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- Number of harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests.

Finally, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
- Total pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.

\[ 30 \text{ bees} \]

Next, calculate the number of bees that returned in the next 6 hours:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees} \]

Then, calculate the number of bees that flew away from the hive in the next 6 hours:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees} \]

Now, calculate the total number of bees that left the hive in the first 12 hours:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 \text{ bees} \]

Since every bee that left before returns to the hive in the next 6 hours, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is equal to the total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours:
\[ 105 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, Debra saw 105 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, let's calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per client = 2 bottles * $2 per bottle = $4.
- Cost of cloths per client = 1 pack * $5 per pack = $5.
- Total expense per client = $4 + $5 = $9.

For 8 clients, the total expenses are:
- Total expenses = 8 clients * $9 per client = $72.

Now, let's calculate the total income:
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses.
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20.

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

answer:  To determine the total number of Lego blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. Therefore, it has:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set. Therefore, it has:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Now, we add the number of pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego blocks.

answer:  To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many friends Charlie has.
2. Use the information that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy to find out how many friends Dorothy has.
3. Use the information that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy to find out how many friends James has.

Given:
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.
- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.

First, let's find out how many friends Dorothy has:
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{\text{Charlie's friends}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how many friends James has:
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has \( 16 \) friends on Facebook.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:
- Bicycles: 5 bicycles * 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires
- Tricycles: 3 tricycles * 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires
- Unicycles: 1 unicycle * 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire

Next, add up the total number of tires inflated:
- Total tires = 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires

Now, calculate the total revenue from inflating the tires:
- Each tire costs 25 cents, which is $0.25.
- Total revenue = 20 tires * $0.25 per tire = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

answer:  To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 1 child ticket.
2. Calculate the cost of 1 adult ticket.
3. Add the cost of the child ticket and the adult ticket to find the total cost.
4. Add the change received to the total cost to find the total amount given to the cashier.

1. The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.
2. The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
3. The total cost of 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket is:
   \[
   10 + 12 = 22
   \]
4. Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the total amount given to the cashier is:
   \[
   22 + 8 = 30
   \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

answer:  First, convert the distance Steve lives from miles to feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Next, convert the distance Tim lives from miles to feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, calculate the time it takes for Steve to bike home:
15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Then, calculate the time it takes for Tim to skateboard home:
10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time it takes for Tim from the time it takes for Steve:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. The raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 14 - 7 - 9) = \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) = x - 30 \) fries.
5. Ants ate 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

So, we have the equation:
\[ x - 30 - 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - 31 = 5 \]
\[ x = 5 + 31 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 36.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:

Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Finally, let's convert the total length from inches to feet:

Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.

answer:  To determine how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Determine the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays to find the change.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies:
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies.
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's determine the total cost of the cookies:
Each cookie costs $0.10.
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays to find the change:
Carl pays with a $10 bill, which is $10.00.
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, Carl receives $4.00 in change.

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day, so he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one week is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school, so the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

answer:  Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. Therefore, Blake runs:
\[ 15 \times 100 = 1500 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards} \]
She does this 34 times, so Kelly runs:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]
Adding the 100 yards she ran initially, Kelly's total distance is:
\[ 100 + 2720 = 2820 \text{ yards} \]

To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:
\[ 2820 - 1500 = 1320 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 1320 yards farther than the loser.

- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas

Total bananas per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

Total bananas for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

answer:  To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for pens = $6
- Total cost for notebooks = $8
- Total cost for bond paper = $20

Total amount spent = $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6 + 8 + 20=34>>34

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on his school supplies.

answer:  To determine the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the red cars:**
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Total cost of red cars = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the action figures:**
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Total cost of action figures = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Total cost of the doll = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost of all toys:**
   - Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
   - Total cost = \( 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of all the toys is $50.

answer:  To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we first need to calculate the number of fish each person caught.

**Anakin's catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Total fish caught by Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total fish caught by both:**
- Total fish caught by Anakin: 19
- Total fish caught by Locsin: 13

Total fish caught by both:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Answer: 32 fish.

answer:  To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the depth of the water on Monday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the depth on Monday.
3. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday by taking two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The depth of the water on Monday is given as 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

answer:  To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and then apply it repeatedly.

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price Increase Every Two Months**: 20% of $20 = $4
3. **Price After 2 Months**: $20 + $4 = $24
4. **Price After 4 Months**: $24 + $4 = $28
5. **Price After 6 Months**: $28 + $4 = $32
6. **Price After 8 Months**: $32 + $4 = $36
7. **Price After 10 Months**: $36 + $4 = $40
8. **Price After 12 Months**: $40 + $4 = $44
9. **Price After 14 Months**: $44 + $4 = $48
10. **Price After 36 Months**: $48 + $4 = $52

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $52.

answer:  Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

answer:  To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.
2. Subtract the total cost from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the computer and accessories:
- Computer cost: €1090
- Scanner cost: €157
- CD burner cost: €74
- Printer cost: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition:
€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

So, the total cost of the computer and accessories is €1423.

Next, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

answer:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the potential income lost if she does the taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the potential income lost if Jackie does the taxes herself:
- She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour.
- Total income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Next, let's consider the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, let's calculate the net income if Jackie hires the accountant:
- Net income = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
- Net income = $105 - $90 = $15

If Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more than if she does the taxes herself.

answer:  To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she gets each time:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs per babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

answer:  To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. Spiders:
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders = 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

2. Insects:
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects = 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

3. Rare mutant invertebrates:
   - Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
640 (spiders) + 540 (insects) + 30 (invertebrates) = 1210 legs

answer:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles a day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles on weekdays = 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles a day.
   - There are 2 weekends in a week.
   - Total miles on weekends = 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:

Total miles in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekends) = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

answer:  To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \frac{\text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the components:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50 \text{ per glass} = \$10 \]

Next, calculate the total cost to make one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Since they made $25 in profit, the total revenue they made is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue per gallon} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$10 + \$25 = \$35 \]

Now, calculate the cost of lemons:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = \$35 - \$5 = \$30 \]

Therefore, Juan and his brother spent $30 on lemons.

answer:  First, calculate Jessica's desired monthly payment for each debt by adding 50% to the minimum payment:

- Student loans: $300/month + 50% of $300/month = $300/month + $150/month = $450/month
- Credit card: $200/month + 50% of $200/month = $200/month + $100/month = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500/month + 50% of $500/month = $500/month + $250/month = $750/month

Next, add up all the monthly payments to find the total monthly payment:

$450/month + $300/month + $750/month = $1500/month

Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by the number of months in a year to find the total annual payment:

$1500/month * 12 months/year = $18000/year

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year.

answer:  First, let's determine the age of each bird based on the given information:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds to find the total age:

- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years

So, the total age of the four birds is 51 years.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato:

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds (which is 0.08 minutes)

Total time per potato = 1.5 minutes + 0.08 minutes = 1.58 minutes

Next, we need to find the total time to peel and cut all 60 potatoes:

Total time = 60 potatoes * 1.58 minutes/potato = 94.8 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 94.8 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them up.

1. **First Week:**
   - Lloyd tutored for 5 hours.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Earnings for the first week = \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Second Week:**
   - Lloyd tutored for 8 hours.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - Earnings for the second week = \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings for the first week + Earnings for the second week
   - Total earnings = \( 50 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks.

answer:  Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.
The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500.
He donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.
After the donation, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.
He gives his daughter $200, so he has $1250 - $200 = $1050 left.
He also gives his wife $700, so he has $1050 - $700 = $350 left.
Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have $350.

answer:  To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Chinese people.
2. Subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people to find the number of girls.

First, let's find the total number of Chinese people:
- The total number of Asians is 240.
- The number of Japanese people is 80.
- Therefore, the number of Chinese people is:
  \[
  240 - 80 = 160
  \]

Next, we know the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:
\[
160 - 60 = 100
\]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

1. **Bo's crabs:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's crabs:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Rani's crabs:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Total number of crabs:**
   Add the number of crabs each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
   \]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\).

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time for the well-rounded team:

- First runner: 55 seconds
- Second runner: 55 seconds
- Third runner: 55 seconds
- Fourth runner: 55 seconds

Total time for the well-rounded team = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

Next, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, let's find the difference in time between the two teams:

Difference in time = 222 seconds (well-rounded team) - 220 seconds (less well-rounded team) = 2 seconds

Therefore, the less well-rounded team wins the race by 2 seconds.

answer:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 5W = 200 \).
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

2. **Calculate the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, \( R = 4W \).
   - Substituting \( W = 40 \):
     \[
     R = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm in order to keep Sandra's business.

answer:  To determine the number of votes the loser received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes the winner received.
2. Subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

First, let's calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3 \times 80}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

Next, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner}
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the loser received \boxed{20} votes.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jan's Age:**
   - Jan is currently 30 years old.

2. **Mark's Age Two Years Ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years old.

3. **Mark's Current Age:**
   - Since two years ago Mark was 20 years old, his current age is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) years old.

4. **Jean's Age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jean is 24 years old.

answer:  To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the total interest over the 3 months and add it to the original amount.

1. Calculate the monthly interest:
   - Monthly interest rate = 2% = 0.02
   - Monthly interest = Principal amount × Monthly interest rate
   - Monthly interest = $100 × 0.02 = $2

2. Calculate the total interest over 3 months:
   - Total interest = Monthly interest × Number of months
   - Total interest = $2 × 3 = $6

3. Calculate the total amount Mandy should pay:
   - Total amount = Principal amount + Total interest
   - Total amount = $100 + $6 = $106

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
2. Calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna.
3. Add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total.

Given:
- Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
- Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

First, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} + \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

answer:  First, find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is 3/6 = 1/2.

Next, find the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is 3/6 = 1/2.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, multiply the probabilities of each individual event: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, compare the probabilities:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 = 50%
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/4 = 25%

The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Expressed as a percentage, the answer is 25%.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters and rabbits.

1. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among all small rodents is 160. Therefore, the number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is:
\[
160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find out how many rats are in each cage, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of cages:
\[
\frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ rats per cage}
\]

Thus, there are **15 rats** in each cage.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly requirement by the number of days in a week to find the daily requirement.

First, let's calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- There are 10 ducks.

So, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we divide the weekly requirement by the number of days in a week to find the daily requirement:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the daily requirement is:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets} = 3 \times 20.25 = 60.75 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of food:
\[ \text{Total cost of food} = 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total amount spent by 3:
\[ \text{Amount each friend paid} = \frac{183}{3} = 61 \]

Therefore, each of them paid:
\[ \text{Amount each friend paid} = 61.00 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of bags of wheat sold as \( x \).

The trader buys each bag for $20 and spends $2 to transport each bag, so the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ 30x \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost for \( x \) bags is:
\[ 22x \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is given as $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

answer:  To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. 

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.

The cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.20 + 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = 1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 1.50 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 12.00 \]

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

answer:  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the flamingos, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]
So, they took back 6 pink flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out.

The number of pink flamingos left is:
\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.

Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos at noon on Sunday is:
\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]

The number of white flamingos is the number of pink flamingos that were taken back and painted white, which is 6.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

2. Subtract the number of trees he chops down over 10 years.
3. Subtract the number of trees that die.

First, calculate the total number of trees Tom plants over 10 years:

Finally, subtract the number of trees that die:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 130 \text{ trees} = 39 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees left is:
\[ 130 - 20 - 39 = 71 \text{ trees} \]

answer:  First, determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from each publisher:

- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences:
  \[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
  \[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]
  For 500 sentences:
  \[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

1. Determine the total number of inhabitants in the city.
2. Identify the number of men and women.
3. Calculate the total number of men and women.
4. Subtract the total number of men and women from the total number of inhabitants to find the number of children.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total number of inhabitants in the city of Soda is 23786.
2. The number of men is 8417.
3. The number of women is 9092.
4. The total number of men and women is:
   \[
   8417 + 9092 = 17509
   \]
5. Subtract the total number of men and women from the total number of inhabitants to find the number of children:
   \[
   23786 - 17509 = 6277
   \]

Therefore, the number of children in the city of Soda is \boxed{6277}.

answer:  Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

After the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
So, after the first month, she has 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
So, after the second month, she has 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
So, after the third month, she has 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add up all the cards she has collected:
\[ 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \]

Therefore, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards.

answer:  Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which means he ate 7 sandwiches in a week. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese, so he used:
\[ 7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 2 \text{ slices per sandwich} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

He also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days a week, with each omelet using one more slice than a sandwich. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
So, he used:
\[ 3 \text{ omelets} \times 3 \text{ slices per omelet} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese. Adding all these together:
\[ 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese this week.

answer:  John receives a 1-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in his salary. 

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his weekly salary of $2000:
\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary is:
\[ \text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we add the 1-time monetary reward of $5000 to his new weekly salary:
\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 2100 + 5000 = 7100 \]

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his total weekly earnings by 52 to find his total annual earnings:
\[ \text{Total annual earnings} = 7100 \times 52 = 371,200 \]

Therefore, John made $371,200 that year.

answer:  To determine how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters per pail to get the total amount of water in liters.

First, let's find the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day:
- He gets 5 pails in the morning.
- He gets 6 pails in the afternoon.

So, the total number of pails in a day is:
\[ 5 \text{ (morning)} + 6 \text{ (afternoon)} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur gets in a day is:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

\( \boxed{55} \)

answer:  To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the total number of tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

First, let's calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year:
- Josie's farm has 10 acres.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.

So, the total number of tons of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we convert the total number of tons of grapes into barrels of wine:
- Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine.

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The answer is 100.

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weights together to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = \boxed{2600} \text{ grams} \]

1. Calculate the sum of Brinley's scores on the first five tests.
2. Determine the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests.
3. Subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total score needed to find the required score on the sixth test.

First, let's find the sum of Brinley's scores on the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Next, we calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total score needed to find the required score on the sixth test:
\[ 558 - 438 = 120 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 120 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of pens Janet initially had:
- She had 22 green pens.
- She had 10 yellow pens.

Total initial pens = 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens.

Next, let's calculate the number of pens she bought:
- She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens.
- Total blue pens = 6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 pens.

- She bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens.
- Total red pens = 2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 pens.

Now, let's add the blue and red pens she bought:
- Total pens bought = 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 66 pens.

Finally, let's add the initial number of pens to the pens bought:
- Total pens now = Total initial pens + Total pens bought
- Total pens now = 32 pens + 66 pens = 98 pens.

Therefore, Janet has 98 pens in total.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance Michael rode in the first four weeks:

1. He rode his bike 5 times a week.
2. He rode 25 kilometers each time.
3. In one week, he rode 5 rides * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
4. For four weeks, he rode 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

Next, let's calculate the total distance Michael rode in the next three weeks:

1. He rode his bike 2 times a week.
2. He rode 60 kilometers each time.
3. In one week, he rode 2 rides * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
4. For three weeks, he rode 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

Finally, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total distance Michael rode:

Total distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

Therefore, Michael rode a total of 860 kilometers.

answer:  Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens. Then, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3R \).
Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(R + 2) \).

The total number of eggs produced by all the chickens is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, expand and solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ R = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( 4 \) red chickens.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates, so the total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Twenty dozen cups is 24 cups, so the cost of each cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{24} = 1400 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $1400.

answer:  To find the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought \(4\) cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Wednesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[
\text{Total cakes} = \text{Cakes on Monday} + \text{Cakes on Tuesday} + \text{Cakes on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total cakes} = 4 + 12 + 60
\]
\[
\text{Total cakes} = 76
\]

Therefore, Rose bought a total of \(76\) cakes.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and the shoes:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- The total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs an additional \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

After babysitting, she needs \(60 - 20 = 40\) dollars more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide $40 by $4:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn \boxed{10} times.

answer:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

answer:  To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
2. Determine the total number of customers from the first two days.
3. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \( 100 + 50 = 150 \).
3. The total number of customers from the first two days is \( 100 + 150 = 250 \).
4. The total number of customers by the third day is 500. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is \( 500 - 250 = 250 \).

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \( \boxed{250} \).

answer:  To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide that by his walking speed.

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 1.5 miles
- Width = 6 miles

So, the perimeter is:
\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( T \) he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, over 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

So, the amount of water left in the small pool now is \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water left in the big pool now is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -x = -48 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

answer:  To determine how many points Jojo scored, we first need to calculate the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
   - Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
   - Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   - Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Next, we sum the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
- Jojo's points: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return an additional 10% of the amount.

\[ \text{Additional amount} = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Total amount to return} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to return to find the remaining balance.

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount to return} - \text{Total amount paid} \]

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $220.

answer:  First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

1. Harriet is currently 21 years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is \(3 \times 21 = 63\) years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is \(2 \times 21 = 42\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:

- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years will be 45 years old.

answer:  To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the first year.
2. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.
3. Add the amounts spent in both years to get the total.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on advertising in the first year:
\[ \text{Amount spent in the first year} = \$15000 \]

Next, let's calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year:
\[ \text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = \$5000 \]

Now, let's add the amounts spent in both years to get the total:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Amount spent in the first year} + \text{Amount spent in the second year} = \$15000 + \$5000 = \$20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \( \$20000 \).

answer:  To determine how many liters of water are in the tank now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of water in the tank.
2. Subtract the amount of water Celine used to water her garden.
3. Add the amount of rainwater she collected.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Initial amount of water in the tank: 120 liters
2. Celine used 90 liters of water to water her garden:
   \[
   120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left:
   \[
   2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Add the rainwater to the remaining water:
   \[
   30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the tank now has **90 liters** of water.

answer:  To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Time spent on crossword puzzles = 3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Time spent on sudoku puzzles = 8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

answer:  To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and the number of petunias.

1. Andy plants 90 geraniums.
2. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

First, let's calculate the number of petunias:
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 50 \]

Next, we add the number of geraniums and the number of petunias to find the total number of flowers:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 140 \]

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces at $0.25 each: \(2 \times $0.25 = $0.50\)
6. Upgrade fee: $3.00

Adding these costs together:
\[ $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the gift card:
\[ $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00.

answer:  To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time for each leg of his trip and then sum them up.

1. **Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, it takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days to travel by car.

Now, we add the time for both legs of the trip:
- Time from New Jersey to Rochester by bus: 6 days
- Time from Rochester to New Jersey by car: 3 days

Total travel time = 6 days + 3 days = 9 days

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days.

answer:  To determine the total cost for Carlos and Benji's rental fees, we need to calculate the cost for each person and then sum these amounts.

Carlos rents a canoe for 3 hours at $30 per hour:
\[ \text{Cost for Carlos} = 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Benji rents a banana boat raft for 5 hours at $18 per hour:
\[ \text{Cost for Benji} = 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs for both Carlos and Benji:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Carlos} + \text{Cost for Benji} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initial counts:
- Fire type cards: 30
- Grass type cards: 20
- Water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- Grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
- Total cards = Fire type cards + Grass type cards + Water type cards
- Total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Next, we calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
- Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
- Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100
- Percentage chance ≈ 33.33%

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is approximately 33%.

\[ \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = \text{Robert's shells} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. According to the problem, Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday.

\[ \text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

Next, determine the number of watermelons remaining after two months:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after two months.

Now, calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest two weeks later:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.

Finally, determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

The answer is 21.

answer:  First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can complete the puzzle.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so her mom can add:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Together, they can complete:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 60 minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

answer:  To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required given that each pizza has 8 slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices needed:
- There are 20 friends.
- Each friend will have 4 slices.

So, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to get 80 slices. Since each pizza has 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

answer:  To determine how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of penguins that go swimming.
2. Calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave.
3. Subtract the number of penguins that go swimming and inside the cave from the total number of penguins.

First, calculate the number of penguins that go swimming:
\[ \text{Number of penguins swimming} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Next, calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave:
\[ \text{Number of penguins inside the cave} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Now, subtract the number of penguins that go swimming and inside the cave from the total number of penguins:
\[ \text{Number of penguins still sunbathing} = 36 - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12} \).

answer:  To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of ants and the number of bugs.

Given:
- There are 50 ants.
- The number of bugs is half the number of ants.

First, calculate the number of bugs:
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{\text{Number of ants}}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, add the number of ants and the number of bugs to find the total number of insects:
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

answer:  To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve needs by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

Next, determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Now, calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

Finally, determine the number of students who went out through exit C:
\[ \text{Number of students through exit C} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students through exit A} - \text{Students through exit B} \]
\[ \text{Number of students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(280\).

answer:  To determine how many total pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider both the pens he initially buys and the new pens he can make from the used ones.

1. **Initial Pens:**
   Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Making New Pens:**
   Ram can make one new pen from five empty pens. Therefore, if he uses 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]

3. **Total Pens:**
   Adding the initial 25 pens to the 5 new pens he can make:
   \[
   25 + 5 = 30 \text{ pens}
   \]

Thus, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of all three girls:
\[
\text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
\[
\boxed{68}

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the extra minutes for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in the plan:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left.

answer:  To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the books they each have and the books they read from each other.

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Dolly reads Pandora's book.
4. Pandora reads Dolly's book.

Let's break it down step by step:

- Dolly starts with 2 books.
- She reads Pandora's 1 book, so she now has 2 + 1 = 3 books.
- Pandora starts with 1 book.
- She reads Dolly's 2 books, so she now has 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read by the end is:

- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.

Adding these together gives the total number of books they will collectively read:

\[ 3 \text{ (Dolly's books)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's books)} = 6 \text{ books} \]

So, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 6 books.

answer:  First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.

\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, let's determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Let \( J \) represent the number of candies James has.

\[ J = R + 6 \]

Substituting \( R = 27 \):

\[ J = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies.

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies.

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

answer:  First, determine the number of penpals Mike currently has. He started with 5 penpals and stopped with 2, so he now has:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]
penpals.

Next, calculate the total number of pages Mike writes each week. Each penpal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long, so each penpal sends:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
pages per week. Since Mike has 3 penpals, he writes:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
pages per week.

Now, calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week. He writes 1 page every 6 minutes, so for 30 pages, he spends:
\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \]
minutes per week.

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 180 \div 60 = 3 \]
hours per week.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

- Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since Isabelle is splitting the cost evenly with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3:

Each person's share = $96 / 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32.

answer:  Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined:
\[ 28 = 2f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries. So, Griffin had \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries left.
4. Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \( 9 + x \) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries. So, Griffin had \( 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x \) fries left.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 7 + x = 27 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin \boxed{20} fries.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jean needs the makeup done:
- She needs 6 hours per day.
- She needs it done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the discount:
- The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Jean paid after the discount:
Total amount paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

  \]

- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
  \[
  2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}
  \]

- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday:
  \[
  5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies}

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the number of boys and girls in the school are:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of girls in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

The total number of students in each class is 20, so the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cows initially in the stalls:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas then divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many new cows are in each stall, we divide the total number of new cows by the number of stalls:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows per stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, there are 16 cows in 8 stalls.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed each day and then sum them up.

Last night:
- Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Rick killed 15 cougars.

Today:
- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's calculate the number of wolves Rick killed today:
- He killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) wolves.

Next, let's calculate the number of cougars Rick killed today:
- He killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.

Now, let's add up all the animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed = 25 + 57 = 82 animals

answer:  To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Determine how many times Robert went down the water slide based on Anne's times.

First, let's calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, and Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - (0.30 \times 30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times \text{Anne's times} \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 52 apples and has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can calculate Jamal's apples as follows:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Therefore, the number of bananas Jamal has is:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, the number of bananas Andrea has is:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

answer:  First, we need to determine the total weight of the 200-foot redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, a 200-foot tree would weigh:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \times 400 \text{ pounds/foot} = 80000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find out how much wood they ate, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 80000 \text{ pounds} = 0.30 \times 80000 \text{ pounds} = 24000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight:
\[ 80000 \text{ pounds} - 24000 \text{ pounds} = 56000 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining redwood tree weighs 56000 pounds.

answer:  To find out how much Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Pennies:
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Value of pennies = 100 pennies * $0.01 per penny = $1.00

2. Nickels:
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Value of nickels = 40 nickels * $0.05 per nickel = $2.00

3. Dimes:
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Value of dimes = 20 dimes * $0.10 per dime = $2.00

4. Dollar bills:
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - Value of dollar bills = 40 dollar bills * $1.00 per bill = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

answer:  Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so she owes 0.50 * 8 = $<<0.50*8=4.00>>4.00 for the books.
She also owes a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.
Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00.

answer:  To determine how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard.
2. Calculate the number of trees in Harry's yard.
3. Find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.

First, let's find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard:
- Chris has 6 trees.
- Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
- Therefore, Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.

Next, let's find the number of trees in Harry's yard:
- Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
- Therefore, Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard:
- The difference is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \) trees.

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

answer:  To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pennies in the stack.
2. Convert the number of pennies into dollars.

First, let's find the number of pennies in the stack:

\[ \text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 \]

\[ \text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200 \]

Next, we convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[ \text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6,200}{100} \]

\[ \text{Total dollar amount} = 62 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2 \times 36}{12} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for 30 cookies. Using the same proportion:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{2 \times 30}{12} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ cups}
\]

Therefore, Carla will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees:

\[ \text{Time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.4 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil:

\[ \text{Time to cook} = 20 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add up all the times to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:

\[ \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 63 \text{ minutes} \]

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, calculate the total price of the house:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Finally, determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
Difference = Total price - Budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = \text{Carmen's money} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125

3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = \text{Samantha's money} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175

Now, we sum the amounts of money all three girls have:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}

\[
\text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 = 400

Next, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, calculate the remaining loan amount:
Remaining loan amount = $250,000

Next, add up all the expenses:
Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds are $118,000.

answer:  To find the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for each house is:
  \[
  3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows per house}
  \]

Next, let's add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in each house is:
  \[
  6 \text{ windows per house} + 4 \text{ windows per house} = 10 \text{ windows per house}
  \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is:
\[
2 \text{ houses} \times 10 \text{ windows per house} = 20 \text{ windows}
\]

Therefore, there are 20 windows in total.

answer:  To find the total amount spent by the real estate agent, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5/ad * 50 ads = $<<5*50=250>>250

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.
- Total cost for television ads = $75/ad * 15 ads = $<<75*15=1125>>1125

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1,375 on buying all the ads.

answer:  To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
   So, the second bag has 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   So, the third bag has 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:
\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762
\]

Therefore, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms.

answer:  To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

Therefore, Sean has to memorize \(138\) lines.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so it takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

answer:  To determine how much change the cashier gives back, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Let's add these amounts together:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
- Amount paid: $20.00
- Total cost: $15.00

Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Now, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds:
- Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
- Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

answer:  Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \), and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[ \boxed 6 \]

Sam is currently 6 years old.

answer:  To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

1. **Time for small holes:**
   - It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - For 30 small holes: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes.

2. **Time for large holes:**
   - It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
   - For 15 large holes: \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes.

3. **Total time in minutes:**
   - Total time = \( 90 + 150 = 240 \) minutes.

4. **Convert total time to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \( \frac{240}{60} = 4 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

\[ M + R = 20 \]

We need to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

Simplifying this expression:

\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 40 \]

answer:  To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length of the sterling silver beads by the length of one sterling silver bead to find the number of beads.

1. The total length of the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   17 \times 4 = 68
   \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Now, let's find the total number of spots for all the snakes combined:

\[ \text{Total number of spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

answer:  To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
\[ \text{Cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
\[ \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of popsicles} + \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 5 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \).
- There are also 3 coaches.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to serve 39 people. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we calculate the number of pizzas needed:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195.

answer:  To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the known rows.

1. Three rows of 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Two rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the known rows:
\[
24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars}
\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Therefore, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[
76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars}
\]

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row:
\[
\frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows}
\]

Thus, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether.

answer:  To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to calculate the number of stories each person wrote in both the first and second weeks and then sum them up.

1. Alani:
   - First week: 20 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 20 = 40 stories
   - Total for Alani: 20 + 40 = 60 stories

2. Braylen:
   - First week: 40 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 40 = 80 stories
   - Total for Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120 stories

3. Margot:
   - First week: 60 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 60 = 120 stories
   - Total for Margot: 60 + 120 = 180 stories

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by all three:

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars consumed by the adults. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars consumed by the adults from the total number of chocolate bars:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

answer:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

The car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover the same 480 miles at a speed of 30 miles/hour:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance. The answer is 16 hours.

answer:  To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. Therefore, the total weight of the flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( M \).

Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has:
\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Together, Ali and Izzy have:
\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, together they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means:
\[ 39 = \frac{1}{10}M \]

To find \( M \), we can solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:
\[ 39 \times 10 = M \]
\[ M = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

answer:  On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the first day:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 activities

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the second day:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 activities

Total activities over the two days:
170 activities (first day) + 200 activities (second day) = 370 activities

Therefore, the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 370.

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 18 + 1 = 19 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the total points for all three players:

22 (Mike) + 19 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 84 points.

So, the total points for all three players is 84 points.

answer:  Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break in between.

First, let's calculate the total time she spends working:
- From 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. is 2 hours.
- From 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 1 hour.
- She takes a 30-minute break.

So, the total working time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 2.5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 90 minutes, we divide the total working time by 10 minutes and then multiply by $5:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times \$5 = 9 \times \$5 = \$45 \]

Therefore, Susan earns $45.

answer:  To determine how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges washed by the oldest son.
2. Calculate the number of oranges washed by the youngest son.
3. Find the total number of oranges washed by both sons.
4. Subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges.

1. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
2. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he washes \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) oranges.
3. The total number of oranges washed by both sons is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \).
4. Will initially bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is \( 15 - 12 = 3 \).

Therefore, there are 3 oranges left unwashed.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a day:
- Distance to work: 30 miles
- Distance back home: 30 miles
- Total distance per day: 30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles

Next, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a week:
- Total distance per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week

Now, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year:
- Total distance per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Next, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Cost for miles: 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year

Finally, let's add the monthly bonus:
- Monthly bonus: $150
- Total annual cost: $30,000/year + $150 * 12 months = $31,800/year

answer:  To determine by how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold on the days he was open:
- On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

Sam sold 65 crates during the week.

Next, we compare this to his target of 120 crates:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

answer:  To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \]

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \times 5 \text{ members} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total weight of the rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the rice will last for 3 weeks.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the desk for Carmen, we need to follow the sequence of bids and calculate the final bid.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. The first bid increases by $50, so the new bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The second bid increases by $50, so the new bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The third bid increases by $50, so the new bid is $300 + $50 = $350.
5. The fourth bid increases by $50, so the new bid is $350 + $50 = $400.
6. The fifth bid increases by $50, so the new bid is $400 + $50 = $450.
7. The sixth bid increases by $50, so the new bid is $450 + $50 = $500.

Carmen's final bid is at $500. Therefore, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is $500.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the second year.

First, we know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we know that the total number of books over the three years is 250. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 250 - 90 - 50 = 115 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total earnings for the second year are:
\[ 115 \times 20 = 2300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{2300} \]

answer:  To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the structure of the tabloid. Each page on the tabloid is printed on two sides of a piece of paper: the left side and the right side.

For a 32-page tabloid:
- Page 1 is printed on the left back.
- Page 2 is printed on the left front.
- Page 3 is printed on the right back.
- Page 4 is printed on the right front.
- Page 5 is printed on the left back.
- Page 6 is printed on the left front.
- ...
- Page 31 is printed on the right back.
- Page 32 is printed on the right front.

Since each page is printed on two sides of a piece of paper, the total number of pieces of paper used is the same as the number of pages in the tabloid.

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is:
\[ 32 \text{ pages} = 32 \text{ pieces of paper} \]

answer:  To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.
2. Determine the total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, which is twice the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.
3. Calculate how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal.

First, let's find the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:
- On Monday: 16 minutes
- On Sunday: 23 minutes

Total time on Monday and Sunday = 16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes

Next, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined:
Goal time = 2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal:
- Time needed on Tuesday = Goal time - Time already exercised
- Time needed on Tuesday = 78 minutes - 39 minutes = 39 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes to reach his goal.

answer:  First, we need to determine Joey's weekly weight loss. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we need to find out how long it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

First, calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people.

Next, subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he wrestled to find out how many people he lost to:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

answer:  First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours each day.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- He works 5 days a week.

Weekly earnings = 10 hours/day * $10/hour * 5 days/week = $500/week

Next, let's add the $300 bonus he receives each week if the company performs well:
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate Watson's monthly earnings for April:
- April has 4 weeks.

Monthly earnings with bonus = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed well for the whole month.

answer:  First, calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

Next, determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:
\[ \text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

Then, calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves} \]

Therefore, 5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

3 people * 3 eggs/person = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs/day

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day:

2 people * 2 eggs/person = <<2*2=4>>4 eggs/day

Now, let's add the eggs consumed by both groups to find the total daily consumption for the family:

9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs/day

Finally, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days):

13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs/week

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

answer:  To determine how many new limbs the serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs that will be grown over the given period.

1. **Number of new arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of new arms grown is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Number of new legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, the number of new legs grown is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the number of new arms and legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ arms} + 3 \text{ legs} = 8 \text{ limbs}
     \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1250

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$6000 + $150 + $1250 = $7400

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has:
$6000 + $2000 = $8000

Finally, let's calculate how much he has left for gifts for business partners:
$8000 - $7400 = $600

3 families with 4 people: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

Total invited: \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:

8 people couldn't come due to illness.
1/4 of that number had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people

Total people who couldn't come: \(8 + 2 = 10\) people

answer:  Let's denote the current population of Chile as \( P \).

Currently, Cera is 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years old.

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) years old.

According to the problem, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

The problem also states that six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{P}{2} = 60000 \]

To find the current population \( P \), we solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 60000 \times 2 \]
\[ P = 120000 \]

So, the current population of Chile is \( 120000 \).

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, let's find Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, we find Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

answer:  Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

1. There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
2. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{6D}{2} = 105 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 6D = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ D = \frac{210}{6} \]
\[ D = 35 \]

So, there are 35 players on the defense.

answer:  To determine the number of electric poles required, we start by understanding the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) represent the number of electric poles. According to the ratio:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \( P \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
P \times 3 = 1 \times 45
\]

\[
3P = 45
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
P = \frac{45}{3}
\]

\[
P = 15
\]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times \$0.10/\text{cubic foot} = \$12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

Calculate the number of marbles his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the total number of marbles Solomon received is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ marbles} \]

Adding these to the initial 50 marbles in the store:
\[ 50 + 28 = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of these marbles. Each marble weighs 2 kilograms.

\[ \text{Total weight} = 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 156 \text{ kg} \]

answer:  To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to add the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children.

1. **Number of boys:**
   The classroom has 30 boys.

2. **Number of girls:**
   The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of non-gendered children:**
   The number of non-gendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of non-gendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total number of children:**
   Add the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123. #### 123

answer:  To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Cooling effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - If the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, the number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \).

2. **Weakening effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters.

3. **Weakening effect of added cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   - The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effect from the ice cubes and the weakening effect from the cream.
   - Total weakening effect = 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the party initially. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, 10 people left the party. The number of people who stayed is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30 and 22 of them are men, the number of women who stayed is:

\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. After 10 people left, and 8 women stayed, the number of women left is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 women left.

answer:  Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \).

So, the equation for Jam's pencils is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:
\[ 26 \text{ (Jam's pencils)} + 46 \text{ (Meg's pencils)} = 72 \text{ pencils} \]

Since each box contains 8 pencils, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pencils}}{8 \text{ pencils/box}} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \( 9 \) boxes to store all their pencils.

2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
3. He gives out 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   28 - 3 = 25 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

So, Oscar has 23 lollipops left.

The number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.
Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.
Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.
The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

answer:  Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as \( x \).

According to the problem, each person trades 2 old records for 1 new one. Therefore, each person receives \( \frac{x}{2} \) new records.

Since there are 5 people, the total number of new records they receive is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \]

We are given that the total number of new records they leave with is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 14 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 2.8 \]

So, each person brought in 2.8 old records. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records brought in is:
\[ 5 \times 2.8 = 14 \]

The 5 people brought in 14 old records.

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

3. We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000/year
- Tax: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400/year

answer:  To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone, we need to calculate the total time required to charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

1. Calculate the number of percentage points needed to be charged:
   \[
   100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]

2. Determine the time required to charge 40 percentage points at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 40\% \times 3 \text{ minutes/point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone.

answer:  To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards received from the loyalty card.
2. Apply the rewards discount to the purchase.
3. Apply the coupon discount.

First, let's calculate the rewards received from the loyalty card. The customer spent $43, and the loyalty card gives $1 off for every $20 spent.

\[ \text{Rewards} = \left\lfloor \frac{43}{20} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.15 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Next, apply the rewards discount to the purchase:

\[ \text{Price after rewards} = 43 - 2 = 41 \]

Now, apply the coupon discount. The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price:

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

\[ \text{Final price} = 41 - 4 = 37 \]

Therefore, the customer paid $37 on this shopping trip.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments * $350 per installment = $2,100

Total cost of Furniture United's offer = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments * $250 per installment = $2,250

Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
- Total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450
- Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer: $3,350

Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.

answer:  First, we need to find the total number of paintball guns. 

DJ has 8 guns.
Nick has 10 guns.
RJ has 1 gun.
Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, the total number of paintball guns is 24.

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the guns. There are 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ).

Finally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each person would get:
\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, each person would have 6 paintball guns.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \). According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs.

The total number of legs for the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

The total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is 160.

Next, calculate the new price of the stock after the first year's increase:
- Initial stock price: $8
- Increase: 50% of $8 = $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4
- New stock price: $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12

Then, calculate the new price of the stock after the second year's decrease:
- New stock price: $12
- Decrease: 25% of $12 = $12 * 0.25 = $<<12*0.25=3>>3
- Final stock price: $12 - $3 = $<<12-3=9>>9

Finally, calculate the final value of Maria's shares:
- 8 shares * $9 per share = $<<8*9=72>>72

So, the final value of all of Maria's shares is $72.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the two equal groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the two equal groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

answer:  To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June to get the total distance.

First, let's find the new daily distance:
- Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day.
- His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more.
- To find the additional distance, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- Therefore, the new daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, we calculate the total distance for June:
- June has 30 days.
- The total distance covered is \( 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \).

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters.

answer:  Let's determine the weight of each animal based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

answer:  To determine how many balls Josh starts to juggle at the talent show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of balls Josh starts with.
2. Add the number of balls he adds over the four weeks.
3. Subtract the number of balls lost during the talent show.

1. **Initial number of balls:**
   Josh starts with 3 balls.

2. **Balls added over four weeks:**
   Josh adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks.
   \[
   1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \text{ balls}
   \]

3. **Balls lost during the talent show:**
   Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost.
   \[
   3 \text{ balls} - 2 \text{ balls} - 1 \text{ ball} = 0 \text{ balls}
   \]

Therefore, after accounting for the balls added and the balls lost, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 0 balls.

answer:  To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up all the outfits she has received.

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Since she received 24 outfits from her friend, twice that amount is \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[ 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 \]

Therefore, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby.

answer:  To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts before the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final price.

1. The total cost of the 2 shirts before the discount is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The discount amount is 40% of the total cost:
   \[
   0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final price:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

answer:  To find the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs:
- There are 40 tables with 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for these tables is:
  \[
  40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
- There are 50 tables with 3 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for these tables is:
  \[
  50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs}
  \]

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of tables:
\[
160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs}
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[
310 \text{ legs}

answer:  To determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of Juice Box B.
2. Calculate the cost of Juice Box C.
3. Find the difference between the cost of Juice Box C and Juice Box B.

First, let's find the cost of Juice Box B:
- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A.
- Therefore, Juice Box B costs \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of Juice Box C:
- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A.
- Therefore, Juice Box C costs \(4 + 7 = 11\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of Juice Box C and Juice Box B:
- Juice Box C costs $11.
- Juice Box B costs $9.
- The difference is \(11 - 9 = 2\) dollars.

Thus, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

answer:  Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, which contains 36 cookies.

She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box for 5 days a week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies given to her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

answer:  To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the daisies.
2. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
3. Find the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and roses.
4. Subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots April initially bought.

1. The number of plant pots needed for the daisies is 30.
2. The number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
3. The total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and roses is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \).
4. April initially bought 100 plant pots. Therefore, the number of plant pots left over is \( 100 - 90 = 10 \).

Thus, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

answer:  To find the total duration of all Peyton's after-work activities, we need to add up the hours of each activity.

1. Monday: 1 hour yoga class
2. Tuesday: Cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga class
   - Cooking class = 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours
3. Wednesday: Half-hour cheese-tasting event
   - Cheese-tasting event = 0.5 hours
4. Thursday: Museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class
   - Museum tour = 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. Friday: Two hours of errands
   - Errands = 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total duration = 1 hour + 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours
Total duration = 8 hours

Therefore, all Peyton's after-work activities will take 8 hours in total.

2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Use the combined height to find the height of the tallest tree.

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree.
   \[
   \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
   \[
   \text{Combined height of the shortest and second trees} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
   \[
   \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time John spent on all activities:

1. Boating: 6 hours
2. Swimming: Half of the boating time, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. Watching shows: 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

According to the problem, this 15 hours represents 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time John spent on vacation.

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

We also know that Andrea had $36 in the beginning. After spending $15, she would have:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

This means that the rest of the money she had initially, which is $21, is the amount she saved. Therefore, Andrea saved:
\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
\[ 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Annabelle already has $80 in savings. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract her current savings from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{320}\).

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money Billy had left after buying the gumballs. He started with $10 and spent $2 on gumballs:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, so he spent half of $8:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he spent $6 on candy (since he started with $10 and spent $4 on gumballs, leaving $6 for candy).

The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants to do:

1. Mini-golf: $5 per round * 1 round = $5
2. Arcade tokens: $5
3. Go-karts: $10 per ride * 2 rides = $20

Total cost for these activities: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan has $90 budgeted for her birthday party. Subtracting the cost of the activities from her budget gives us the remaining amount:

$90 - $30 = $60

Now, let's assume Morgan wants to invite \( n \) friends. The total number of people (including herself) will be \( n + 1 \).

The total cost for the activities is $60. Let's assume each person spends $5 on activities. Therefore, the equation for the total cost is:

\[ 5(n + 1) = 60 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ n + 1 = 12 \]
\[ n = 11 \]

So, Morgan can invite 11 friends.

Next, calculate the total cost of the teddy bears:
\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears:

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After buying the toys, he has:
\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10:
\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, Dean has \$21 left.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Marisa saves each day.

1. Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.
2. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day.

The cost of the lollipops each day is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the amount of money Marisa saves each day is:
\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she saves over 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank after 5 days.

answer:  First, calculate the time it took John to drive to his friend's house:
- Distance to his friend's house: 210 miles
- Speed: 70 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Next, calculate the time it took John to drive back home:
- Distance back home: 240 miles
- Speed: 80 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, add the times for both legs of the trip to find the total time:
- Total time = Time to his friend's house + Time back home
- Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Therefore, the trip took John 6 hours.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one round trip:

1. From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. From the third city to the first city: (75 + 100) - 50 = 125 miles

So, the total distance for one round trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 3 \times 300 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it needs service by the distance traveled in one day:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
   \[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, which is:
  \[
  \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

  \]
- For 3 collie beds:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}

answer:  First, let's determine the number of customers kicked out for each reason:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those who refused to wear masks minus 5:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
3. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

Next, we add up the number of customers kicked out for these specific reasons:
\[
3 + 7 + 21 = 31
\]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the specific reasons from the total number of people kicked out:
\[
50 - 31 = 19
\]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19} \).

answer:  To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Given:
- There are 6 girls in the park.
- There are twice the number of boys in the park.

Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of girls is twice the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ 6 = 2B \]

To find the number of boys, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ B = 3 \]

So, there are 3 boys in the park.

Now, to find the total number of kids, we add the number of girls and the number of boys:
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, there are 9 kids in the park.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to account for the students who were absent on Friday. We know that 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

answer:  To determine the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test to meet or exceed a total of 42 points, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total points Jane has already scored from the first two tests.
2. Determine the remaining points needed to reach or exceed 42 points.
3. Subtract the points she has already scored from the total points needed to find the minimum score required on the third test.

First, let's calculate the total points Jane has already scored from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need to determine the remaining points needed to reach or exceed 42 points:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane needs at least 9 points on her third test to meet or exceed a total of 42 points.

answer:  To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then sum them up.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Sales on Saturday: \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Sales on Sunday: \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.
   - However, six pairs were returned.
   - Total pairs sold on Sunday: \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

Now, we sum up the pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of the picture frames:
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- With a 20% additional cost, each frame will cost $20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $20 + $4 = $24.
- For 44 seniors, the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, calculate the cost of the pins:
- Each pin costs $5.
- For 2 seniors, the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Finally, calculate the cost of the cords:
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.
- Each cord costs $12.
- For 11 officers, the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

answer:  To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of points Sara scored.
2. Determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points.
3. Calculate the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points.

Step 1: Sara scored 8 points.

Step 2: After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we calculate Erin's points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Step 3: To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper.
2. Determine the amount saved by the DIY project.
3. Subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper.**
The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

**Step 2: Determine the amount saved by the DIY project.**
The DIY project saves 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]
So, the savings is $80.

**Step 3: Subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost.**
Subtract the savings from the original cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]
So, the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper is \boxed{320}.

2. Subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment to find the value of the functioning equipment.

First, let's calculate the value of the faulty equipment:
\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 40\% \text{ of } \$400,000 \]
\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 0.40 \times 400,000 \]
\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = \$160,000 \]

Next, subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment to find the value of the functioning equipment:
\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = \$400,000 - \$160,000 \]
\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = \$240,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \$240,000.

answer:  Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day.

First, let's determine how many sheep give 1 kg of milk and how many give 2 kg of milk:
- Half of 30 sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.
- So, 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each.
- The other half of 30 sheep is also 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.
- So, 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of milk collected every day:
- Milk from the 15 sheep that give 1 kg each: 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
- Milk from the 15 sheep that give 2 kg each: 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding these together, the total amount of milk collected every day is:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

#### 45 kg of milk every day.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples she picked for $56.
   - The price per apple is $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) apples.

Now, we sum up the number of apples picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total number of apples picked over the three days is \( 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \) apples.

Therefore, Lucy picked 50 apples over the three days.

2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green.
4. Calculate the number of pupils who like yellow.

1. Half of the class likes blue:

   So, 5 pupils like green.

4. The rest of the pupils like yellow. Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is:
   \[
   40 - 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

So, the number of pupils who like yellow is 15.

answer:  To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the total number of socks Lindsay has washed:
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
- Each pair consists of 2 socks.
- Therefore, the total number of socks from the pairs is:
  \[
  10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
  \]

Next, we add the loose socks:
- Lindsay washes 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[
20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing:
\[
50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks}
\]

Therefore, Lindsay has missed \boxed{15} socks.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:
- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- Millie makes 3 pitchers.
- Total cups = 3 pitchers * 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the cups:
- Each cup is sold for $1.
- Total revenue = 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Total cost = $18 (supplies)
- Profit = $36 - $18 = $18

Finally, let's determine the profit per hour:
- Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
- Profit per hour = Total profit / Total hours
- Total profit = $18
- Total hours = 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours
- Profit per hour = $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

So, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour running the lemonade stand.

answer:  To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time: 8 hours

Distance_Cho = Speed × Time
Distance_Cho = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time: 5 hours

Distance_Chloe = Speed × Time
Distance_Chloe = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance_Cho - Distance_Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

answer:  To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total interest for the five months.
2. Add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid.
3. Divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total interest:
Interest = Principal * Interest Rate
Interest = $3,650 * 0.10
Interest = $365

Next, we add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid:
Total Amount to be Paid = Principal + Interest
Total Amount to be Paid = $3,650 + $365
Total Amount to be Paid = $4,015

Finally, we divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount to be Paid / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $4,015 / 5
Monthly Payment = $803

So, Karan has to pay $803 per month.

answer:  Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
In total, Axel has 50 silver pesos + 80 gold pesos = 130 pesos.
In total, Anna has 100 silver pesos + 120 gold pesos = 220 pesos.
The total number of pesos they have together is 130 pesos + 220 pesos = 350 pesos.

answer:  To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- One eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, 6 erasers cost:
  \[
  6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 \text{ per eraser} = \$12
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- One pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, 8 pencils cost:
  \[
  8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 \text{ per pencil} = \$24
  \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
\[
\$12 + \$24 = \$36
\]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the members are boys and 50% are girls:

- Number of boys = 52 * 0.50 = 26 boys
- Number of girls = 52 * 0.50 = 26 girls

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of girls performing is:

- Number of girls performing = 26

On the day of the performance, half of the girls performing can't make it to the show:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13 girls

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Total number of people singing = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

Thus, the number of people who sang in the performance is \boxed{16}.

answer:  Let \( x \) be the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

After selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

answer:  Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combine like terms:

\[11x = 165\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\)
- Sam's popsicles: \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\).

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, for each ride, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \]

For 9 rides, the total cost is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David to buy a ride bracelet for all 9 rides.

A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. Therefore, the cost for one ride bracelet is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, let's compare the total cost for Dasha and the total cost for David:

- Total cost for Dasha: \$36
- Total cost for David: \$30

David saves the difference between the total cost for Dasha and the total cost for David:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \$6.

1. James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
2. James delivers \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

First, calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu:
\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson}
\]
\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
\]
\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = 22
\]

Next, add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[
\text{Total messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu}
\]
\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, James delivers a total of \(88\) messages.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap. 

Monica has:
- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap.

Next, we know that Monica has 144 inches of ribbon. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of pre-made Valentine's cards Erica's dad brought her:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ cards per box} = 30 \text{ cards} \]

Next, add the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards:
\[ 20 \text{ cards} + 30 \text{ cards} = 50 \text{ cards} \]

Then, subtract the cards she passed out:
\[ 50 \text{ cards} - 24 \text{ cards} = 26 \text{ cards} \]
\[ 26 \text{ cards} - 5 \text{ cards} = 21 \text{ cards} \]
\[ 21 \text{ cards} + 17 \text{ cards} = 38 \text{ cards} \]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: Half of the writing time, so \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
- Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, let's find the total time spent on all activities:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours

Now, let's calculate the percentage of her total work time spent editing:
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services with the discount.

1. Netflix costs $10 per month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 per month, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
3. Tim saves 20% for bundling, so he saves 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
4. Therefore, the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $16
- Disney Plus: $16

Total cost of streaming services = $10 + $16 + $16 = $42 per month

Next, let's determine how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription:
- Cost of cable package: $60
- Cost of streaming services: $42

Savings = $60 - $42 = $18 per month

#### $18 per month.

answer:  To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Alice's age.
2. Determine Beth's age.
3. Calculate the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.

First, let's find Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, let's find Alice's age:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Now, we calculate the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the slices Jenny eats:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, there are 3 slices left.

answer:  To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Millipedes:**
   - Nancy saw \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many millipedes as spiders.
   - Number of millipedes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).

3. **Stink bugs:**
   - The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   - Number of stink bugs = \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, we add up all the bugs:
- Number of spiders = 90
- Number of millipedes = 30
- Number of stink bugs = 48

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs.

answer:  Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts/day} \]

If he uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day instead, he uses:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts/day} \]

The difference in energy usage per day is:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts/day} - 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 4500 \text{ watts/day} \]

To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts} \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

1. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:**
   - The builder works 4 weeks every month.
   - The builder works 6 days every week.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a month is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) days.

2. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a year is \( 24 \times 12 = 288 \) days.

3. **Calculate the builder's annual earnings:**
   - The builder gets paid $50 every day.
   - Therefore, the annual earnings are \( 288 \times 50 = 14,400 \) dollars.

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

answer:  Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs twice the amount of flour and twice the amount of milk compared to a normal batch.

For a normal batch, he needs:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, he needs:
- 6 cups of flour
- 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs:
- 6 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 3 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs:
- 4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- Number of bags of flour = 3
- Number of bottles of milk = 2

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk
Difference = 3 - 2 = 1

Mark has to buy 1 more bag of flour than bottles of milk.

answer:  Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps} \]

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he has taken so far is:

\[ 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the number of steps taken during his jog is:

\[ 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps} \]

Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

answer:  Tyson needs to serve 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, he needs to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he will need:
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost for the meat is:
- 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost for the cheese is:
- 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00

The total cost for the meat and cheese is:
- $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

answer:  To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to find the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
   - Another zebra with half as many stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

   Adding these together:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. Count the number of zebras:
   - There are 4 zebras.

3. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{4} = 22 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22 stripes.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of corn Allan has initially. Since he has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis:

\[ \text{Number of corn} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Now, let's find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of cannolis} + \text{New number of corns} \]
\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 + 40 = 140 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:

1. The first package costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first package, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.
3. The total cost before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount:

1. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
2. The total cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework:

1. The finale firework costs $150.
2. The total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent a total of $1110.

answer:  In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained. The number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The total amount paid in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 18000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 36000 \text{ dollars} + 18000 \text{ dollars} = 54000 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \text{Total words} = 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \text{Reading time} = \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes to arrive at the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport:

\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby finishes reading the book in 30 minutes, he will be:

answer:  Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy at a sale where she buys 1 pound for $3 and gets the other pound for 1/2 off. This means she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all her expenses:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total expenses = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10 and spent $7.00. Therefore, the amount of money she has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

answer:  Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \( x \).

Joanne gathered:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- 15 apples from the shortest trees (half of 30)
- \( x \) apples from the average trees

Her sister gathered:
- \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples from the tallest trees
- \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples from the shortest trees
- 0 apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Subtracting 150 from both sides:

\[
x = 500 - 150
\]

\[
x = 350
\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. #### 350

answer:  To determine how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are likely to explode.
2. Determine how many of those candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles are likely to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are likely to explode. Marcy makes 50,000 candles, so:

\[ \text{Number of candles likely to explode} = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will eat in 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies are needed to provide that total number of cookies.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Shannon will eat in 30 days:
- Shannon eats 2 cookies per night.
- There are 30 days.

So, the total number of cookies she will eat is:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies are required to provide 60 cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \div 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of madeleine cookies to ensure she has enough for 30 days.

answer:  To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse.
2. Determine the discounted price per blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

First, let's calculate the discount amount per blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, we find the discounted price per blouse by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price:

\[ \text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Finally, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

answer:  To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver's current position and the elevation of the ledge where the comb fell.

1. Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
2. Elevation of the ledge where the comb fell: 4,000 feet

The difference in elevation is:
\[ 4,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 1,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 1,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the next two days:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \text{ km} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the second week:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Finally, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 180:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( c \):
\[
c = 180 - d
\]

Next, substitute \( c = 180 - d \) into the second equation:
\[
2(180 - d) + d = 304
\]

Simplify and solve for \( d \):
\[
360 - 2d + d = 304
\]
\[
360 - d = 304
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

answer:  To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's and Zack's lockers.

First, we know that Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker} = 5
\]
To find Zack's locker, we solve for Zack's locker by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
\text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20
\]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker} = 20
\]
To find Timothy's locker, we solve for Timothy's locker by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
\text{Timothy's locker} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

Thus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

Next, subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats on the rock:
\[ 50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Then, calculate the number of cats that ran after the mouse:

answer:  First, let's determine the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28, the original price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the remaining amount, which is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in price is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.

answer:  To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money the second company gave him.
2. Add the amounts received from both banks.
3. Add the total amount received to his initial capital.

First, let's find out how much the second company gave him. The second company gave him twice as much as the first bank. The first bank gave him $4000, so the second company gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Finally, we add the total amount received to his initial capital. His initial capital was $5000, so:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]

1. The first 6 months at $8 per month:
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8 \text{ per month} = \$48
   \]

2. The next 6 months at $12 per month:
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$12 \text{ per month} = \$72
   \]

3. The last 6 months at $14 per month:
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$14 \text{ per month} = \$84
   \]

Now, add up the costs for one year:
\[
\$48 + \$72 + \$84 = \$204
\]

Since Bill needs to pay for 2 years, multiply the cost of one year by 2:
\[
\$204 \times 2 = \$408
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service is:
\[
\boxed{\$408}

answer:  To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder and then sum them up.

1. **Store-bought feeders:**
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) birds.

2. **emade feeders:**
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder.
   - Therefore, each homemade feeder attracts \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) birds.
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders.
   - Total birds from homemade feeders: \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) birds.

3. **Total number of birds:**
   - Total birds = birds from store-bought feeders + birds from homemade feeders
   - Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

answer:  Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and $50 for spending, so he needs a total of $100 + $50 = $150.

He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as \( x \).

The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \]

We know that this amount is equal to $150:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 150 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 150 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ x = 150 \times 1.5 \]
\[ x = 225 \]

So, Kenny started with 225 cards.

answer:  To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - There are 4 buses.
   - Each bus can hold 60 employees.
   - Total capacity for buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.

2. **Minibusses:**
   - There are 6 minibusses.
   - Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
   - Total capacity for minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.

3. **Minivans:**
   - There are 10 minivans.
   - Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
   - Total capacity for minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

answer:  To determine the total cost Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half of the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of cake} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

#### Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

answer:  To determine the total number of letters in Indras' and her sister's names, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of letters in Indras' name.
2. Determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name.
3. Add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name.

1. Indras' name has 6 letters.
2. Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.
   Half of the letters in Indras' name is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).
   Therefore, Indras' sister's name has \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) letters.
3. Add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name:
   - Indras' name has 6 letters.
   - Indras' sister's name has 7 letters.
   The total number of letters is \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

So, the total number of letters in Indras' and her sister's names is 13.

answer:  To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the skipping rope is $6.
The cost of the board game is $11.
The cost of the playground ball is $2.

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we calculate how much money Dora currently has:
- She has saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

answer:  The food caterer initially prepared hot dogs for 36 guests. Half of the guests would have two hot dogs, so:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests} \]

Each of these 18 guests would have 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs} \]

The number of hot dogs prepared is 36, so the number of hot dogs not available is:

\[ 80 - 36 = 44 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since each guest gets one hot dog, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

\[ \frac{44}{2} = 22 \text{ guests} \]

Therefore, 22 guests did not get a second hot dog.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Set of pots and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each: \( 5 \times 5 = 25.00 \)

Total cost before discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \times 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final cost:

\[ \text{Final cost} = 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the total cost of her order is $132.00.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in each container. Since there are 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers, each container contains:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Josey used. Since Josey used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, and each container has 3 gallons, she used:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in 1 gallon. Therefore, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]

1. Subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops.
2. Divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, calculate the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends:

answer:  First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He had 1% of his money left, and he spent $5 (which is 500 cents):

\[ 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

So, George had 5 cents left after buying the chips.

Now, let's calculate how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent 120 cents on chips and had 5 cents left:

\[ 500 - 5 = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, let's determine how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents:

\[ \frac{375}{75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is \( \boxed{5} \).

answer:  First, we need to find the total number of oranges bought by Sitti and Juris.

Sitti bought 34 oranges.
Juris bought 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 friends, so there are a total of 2 + 6 = 8 people.

Finally, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get.

Oranges per person = 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges.

answer:  To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne, we need to calculate the travel time for both Wayne and Bernadette and then find the difference.

1. **Wayne's Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's Travel Time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times as long as Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time plus 5 minutes is \(16 + 5 = 21\) minutes.

4. **Difference in Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's travel time is 21 minutes.
   - The difference in travel time is \(21 - 4 = 17\) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives at the theater before him.

   \]

2. Rory and her mom each take one piece, so the total weight of the pieces taken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. Subtract the total weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake:
   \[
   20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:
\[
15 \text{ ounces}
\]

answer:  To determine the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide by the number of servings.

1. Calculate the cost of the onions:
   - Antoine needs 4 pounds of onions.
   - The cost per pound is $2.00.
   - Total cost for onions = 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

2. Calculate the cost of the beef stock:
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - The cost per box is $2.00.
   - Total cost for beef stock = 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost of the soup:
   - Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock
   - Total cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

4. Calculate the cost per serving:
   - Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings
   - Cost per serving = $12.00 / 6 servings = $2

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

**Elizabeth:**
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total for Elizabeth: 20 beads + 40 beads = 60 beads

**Margareth:**
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total for Margareth: 60 beads + 80 beads = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between Elizabeth and Margareth:
- Elizabeth: 60 beads
- Margareth: 140 beads
- Difference: 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

#### 80

Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Jon took for the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James must have taken 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes
- Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so 80 + 5 = 85 minutes
- Run: Let's call this time R minutes

Total time for James = 36 + 85 + R = 180 minutes

Solving for R:
121 + R = 180
R = 180 - 121
R = 59 minutes

So, it took James 59 minutes to run.

answer:  To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is length times width, to find the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

#### 98 feet.

answer:  First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to baking:
- Marcus bakes for 3 hours.
- Every hour, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
- Therefore, the total temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to opening the window:
- Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
- The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
- To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes, we divide 30 minutes by 10 minutes per interval: 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
- Therefore, the total temperature decrease is 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:
- Initial temperature: 40 degrees
- Temperature increase from baking: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees
- Temperature decrease from opening the window: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The final temperature is 49 degrees.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the total distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour × (30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour)
Distance = 32 miles/hour × 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Next, we determine how many bails of hay are needed. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail per mile:

Number of bails = Distance × (1/2)
Number of bails = 16 miles × (1/2)
Number of bails = 8 bails

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay:

Total cost = Number of bails × Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails × $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 6 × $5 = $30.

Finally, we calculate the change Michael has:

Change = Total money Michael has - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A was 20 minutes long.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs, so the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we need to find out how many trays she can put out. Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

\[ \boxed{2} \]

answer:  To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of colors in the six packets that each have eight colors:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ colors per packet} = 48 \text{ colors} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of colors in the four packets that each have sixteen colors:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ colors per packet} = 64 \text{ colors} \]

Now, we add the number of colors from both types of packets:
\[ 48 \text{ colors} + 64 \text{ colors} = 112 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons.

answer:  To determine how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost per balloon.
2. Determine the new cost per balloon after the increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the original cost per balloon:
- Total cost to fill 20 balloons: $900
- Original cost per balloon: $900 / 20 = $45

Next, let's determine the new cost per balloon after the increase:
- Increase in cost per balloon: $20
- New cost per balloon: $45 + $20 = $65

Now, let's calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:
- New cost per balloon: $65
- Number of balloons: 170
- Total cost: $65 * 170 = $11,050

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons.

Finally, we subtract the initial cost of the case from the total revenue to find the profit:
\[ \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is \$539.

answer:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

First, let's calculate the total cost if you buy the super ticket:
- Super ticket cost: $20
- Additional cost for popcorn and soda: $1
- Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

Next, let's calculate the total cost if you buy the regular ticket:
- Movie ticket cost: $12
- Cost of soda: $3
- Cost of popcorn: \( P \)
- Total cost with regular ticket: $12 + $3 + \( P \) = $15 + \( P \)

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the difference between the total cost of the super ticket and the total cost of the regular ticket is $2:
\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is \( \$4 \).

answer:  First, calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna initially has:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $<<8*800=6400>>6400

Next, calculate the value of the rubies she receives:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400

Now, calculate the value of the sapphires she trades away:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $<<3*800=2400>>2400

Subtract the value of the sapphires she trades away from the initial value of the sapphires:
$6400 - $2400 = $<<6400-2400=4000>>4000

Finally, add the value of the rubies to the value of the remaining sapphires after the trade:
$4000 + $2400 = $<<4000+2400=6400>>6400

answer:  First, calculate the volume of one raised bed by multiplying the width, length, and height:
\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, calculate the total volume needed for 10 raised beds:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, determine how many bags of potting soil are needed. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, calculate the total cost of the potting soil:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times \$12 \, \text{per bag} = \$1920 \]

answer:  To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 60 mph × 2 hours
- Distance = 120 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 30 mph × 1 hour
- Distance = 30 miles

Now, add the distances together to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
- Total Distance = 150 miles

Next, calculate the total time taken:
- Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
- Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, divide the total distance by the total time to find the average speed:
- Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
- Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
- Average Speed = 50 mph

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 miles per hour.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in one day.
2. Calculate the total number of apples both people eat in one day.
3. Calculate the total number of apples both people eat in 30 days.

First, let's find out how many apples each person eats in one day:
- Marin eats 4 apples per day.
- Nancy eats 4 apples per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of apples both people eat in one day:
- Total apples per day = Marin's apples per day + Nancy's apples per day
- Total apples per day = 4 apples/day + 4 apples/day = 8 apples/day

Finally, we calculate the total number of apples both people eat in 30 days:
- Total apples in 30 days = Total apples per day * Number of days
- Total apples in 30 days = 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

answer:  To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fairies that Katelyn saw.
2. Determine the number of fairies that came from the east.
3. Add the fairies that came from the east to the initial number of fairies.
4. Subtract the number of fairies that flew away.

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. The number of fairies that came from the east is half of what Katelyn saw:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ fairies}
   \]
3. Adding the fairies that came from the east to the initial number of fairies:
   \[
   50 + 25 = 75 \text{ fairies}
   \]
4. Subtracting the number of fairies that flew away:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45 \text{ fairies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[
\boxed{45}

answer:  First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2 trips

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

answer:  To find the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of red, green, and yellow cards and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
   - Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of puppies with spots. The formula for percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 35 \]

Therefore, 35% of the puppies have spots.

answer:  To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plants Toni has.
2. Determine the number of plants Shondra has.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \text{ of Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Therefore, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

1. Calculate the cost of the pizza.
2. Determine the tip amount.
3. Add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pizza.**
The cost of the pizza is given as $15.

**Step 2: Determine the tip amount.**
The tip is \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the cost of the pizza. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

**Step 3: Add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount.**
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Cost of the pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

So, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is \(\boxed{18}\).

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:

- Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth 2 cents.
  \[
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Grayson recycles 5 plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
  \[
  5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Total weekly earnings:
  \[
  6 + 15 = 21 \text{ cents}
  \]

Next, we multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks):

\[
21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling cans and bottles in a four-week month.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:
\[ \text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has:
\[ \text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:
\[ \text{Total cards} = 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ \text{Cards given to students} = 350 - 50 = 300 \]

Each student receives 10 cards, so the number of students is:
\[ \text{Number of students} = \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

answer:  To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we first need to calculate the number of pieces of laundry per room.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's add up all the pieces of laundry per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total pieces of laundry per room:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms:
\[ 15 \text{ pieces/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 1200 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, there are 1200 pieces of laundry in the 80 rooms.

answer:  To determine Finley's final position, we need to follow the sequence of her movements step by step:

1. She started in 1st place.
2. She fell back 5 spots:
   \[
   1 - 5 = -4
   \]
   So, she is in 4th place.
3. She moved ahead 2 spots:
   \[
   -4 + 2 = -2
   \]
   So, she is in 2nd place.
4. She fell back 3 spots:
   \[
   -2 - 3 = -5
   \]
   So, she is in 5th place.
5. She jumped ahead 1 spot:
   \[
   -5 + 1 = -4
   \]
   So, she is in 4th place.

Since the race has 10 participants, we need to convert the negative position to a positive one:
\[
-4 + 10 = 6
\]

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 6th place.

\[
\boxed{6th place}

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples:

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \]

Becky received a $1 discount:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \]

So, Becky paid $8.

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples:

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \]

So, the discount amount is $1.
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \]

So, Kelly paid $9.

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Kelly's payment} - \text{Becky's payment} = 9 - 8 = 1 \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans Mary needs to bake, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils} \]

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used after two months:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 \text{ pencils} = 60 \text{ pencils} \]

So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 \text{ pencils} - 60 \text{ pencils} = 240 \text{ pencils} \]

At the end of the year, we find out how many pencils are left:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 \text{ pencils} = 80 \text{ pencils} \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ 240 \text{ pencils} - 80 \text{ pencils} = 160 \text{ pencils} \]

   Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes added on Monday:**
   He gains 5 pairs of shoes.
   \[
   200 + 5 = 205 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes added on Wednesday:**
   He gains 15 more pairs of shoes.
   \[
   205 + 15 = 220 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Shoes added on Friday:**
   He gains 30 more pairs of shoes.
   \[
   220 + 30 = 250 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday:**

answer:  To determine the amount of change Theo received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
2. Find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier to find the change.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.**

The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2.
\[
\text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]

**Step 2: Find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper.**

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the pen} + \text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier.**

\[
\text{Change} = 10 - 7 = 3
\]

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is **$3**.

answer:  First, we need to convert the shark's length to the same unit as the remoras. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark's length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:

\[ 6 \text{ inches/remora} \times 2 \text{ remoras} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. We do this by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length and then multiplying by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length.

answer:  To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in three weeks.
2. Determine the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks.
3. Divide the total walking time by the number of days he can walk.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we determine the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks. Since he can walk 4 days a week:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, we divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk (12 days):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Therefore, the total number of cookies Matt can have is:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students with a desktop computer is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).

The number of students who do not have a desktop computer is given as 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x - \frac{3}{4}x = 20 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[ \frac{4}{4}x - \frac{3}{4}x = 20 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4}x = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{1}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{1} \):

\[ x = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

answer:  To determine how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- \( D \) is the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) is the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We know:
- \( |D| = 9 \)
- \( |P| = 6 \)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both, which is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Since there are 32 kids in the class, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

answer:  To find the total cost of the trip, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Cost of the plane tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are 2 tickets, the total cost is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

2. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.
   - They stay for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

3. **Total cost of the trip:**
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.
   - Total cost = $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

The trip cost $15400.

answer:  To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received.

First, let's find the total number of books Sarah bought. She spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15.

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15}
\]

\[
\frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

So, Sarah bought 20 books.

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received.

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4}
\]

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

answer:  To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides} \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 621 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:
\[ 621 \]

answer:  To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, and the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

First, calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of the 1959 penny} \]
\[ \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Next, add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 36 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player. His player can hold up to 100 songs, and he already has 20 songs:

\[ \text{Remaining songs for Gabriel} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Now, we calculate how many more songs Luri can add to her player. Her player can also hold up to 100 songs, and she already has 60 songs:

\[ \text{Remaining songs for Luri} = 100 - 60 = 20 \]

Finally, we find the difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add:

\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

#### Luri can add 60 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

answer:  To determine how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow paint tubes he has based on the information given.

1. **Blue Paint:**
   - Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.
   - Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   - Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.
   - Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint} = \text{Blue paint tubes} + \text{Yellow paint tubes} \]
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint} = 2 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint} = 11 \]

So, Jasper has a total of 11 tubes of paint.

answer:  To determine how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal of $200, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned by both Keegan and Tasha.
2. Subtract the total amount earned from the goal to find out how much more they need to earn.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money earned by Keegan and Tasha:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Keegan's earnings} + \text{Tasha's earnings} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 83 + 91 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 174 \]

Next, we subtract the total amount earned from the goal to find out how much more they need to earn:

\[ \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Total earnings} \]
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 174 \]
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 26 \]

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn $26 to reach their goal.

answer:  To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days.
4. Determine how many bags of oats are needed.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day. Therefore, each horse consumes 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

2. Since there are four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day is 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

3. The total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days is 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

4. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Answer: 4 bags of oats.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.
2. Determine the amount of money Stetson gave up based on the number of oranges he ate.

First, let's find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Stetson ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges.

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. According to the bet, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats.

\[
\text{Total amount of money given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

answer:  To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
2. Convert the total distance into hours based on his running speed.

First, let's calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
- James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.
- Total distance per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Next, we convert the total distance into hours:
- James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
- Total hours per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours a week.

answer:  To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the highest temperatures of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia.
2. Divide the sum by the number of countries.

Let's start with the given temperatures:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

First, add these temperatures together:
\[ -48 + 21 + (-3) \]

Calculate the sum:
\[ -48 + 21 = -27 \]
\[ -27 + (-3) = -30 \]

So, the sum of the highest temperatures is -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, divide this sum by the number of countries (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average highest temperature} = \frac{-30}{3} \]

Calculate the average:
\[ \frac{-30}{3} = -10 \]

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

1. Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays.
2. Subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays:
- Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
- Jaime has 2 trays.

So, the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
- Jaime has 64 eggs.
- He can place 48 eggs on the trays.

So, the number of eggs he won't be able to place on the trays is:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

answer:  First, determine the total number of razors Heather gets from 2 packs of razors:

1. Each pack contains 4 razors.
2. Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.
3. With the "buy one get one free" deal, she only pays for half of the razors, which is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) razors.

Next, apply the $2.00 coupon:

1. The cost of 2 packs of razors is \(2 \times 4 = 8.00\).
2. Subtract the $2.00 coupon: \(8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00\).

Now, calculate the cost per razor:

1. Heather pays for 4 razors for $6.00.
2. The cost per razor is \(\frac{6.00}{4} = 1.50\).

Since $1.50 is equivalent to 150 cents, each individual razor will cost 150 cents after the discount.

1. Identify the cost of the small pizza.
2. Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.
3. Add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total cost.

Step 1: Identify the cost of the small pizza.
The small pizza costs $8.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.
The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Step 3: Add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total cost.
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total amount Sally spends is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars.

answer:  First, let's determine the total height of each layer of the pyramid:

1. The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall: 4 * 64 = 256 inches.
2. The next layer has 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall: 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
3. The next layer has 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall: 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
4. The top layer has 1 cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall: 1 * 60 = 60 inches.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers:

256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches.

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

636 inches / 12 = 53 feet.

So, the human pyramid is 53 feet tall.

- Morning rides: 2
- Afternoon rides: 2
- Total rides per day: 2 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 4 rides

Next, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days: 4 rides/day * 14 days = 56 rides

Now, calculate the cost of each type of ride:
- Morning ride cost: $6
- Afternoon ride cost: $2

Calculate the total cost for each type of ride:
- Total cost for morning rides: 56 rides * $6/ride = $336
- Total cost for afternoon rides: 56 rides * $2/ride = $112

Finally, calculate the total cost for all rides:
- Total cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $336 + $112 = $448

So, Paul spent $448 on driving his car during these 14 days.

answer:  Let's denote the number of guests as \( g \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food is $5 per person.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5g \).

For the second venue:
- The cost per person is $25.
- There is no additional cost for food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25g \).

To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the total costs equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5g = 25g \]

Now, solve for \( g \):

\[ 200 = 25g - 5g \]
\[ 200 = 20g \]
\[ g = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ g = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

answer:  To determine Angela's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Brett's current age.
2. Determine Brett's age in four years.
3. Calculate Angela's age in four years based on the given relationship.
4. Find Angela's current age by subtracting four years from her age in four years.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, Angela will be:
   \[
   3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years:
   \[
   42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

\boxed{38}

answer:  First, calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, find the total number of oranges both brought:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, calculate the number of pies they can make:
\[ 120 \text{ oranges} \div 3 \text{ oranges/pie} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley can make 40 Greek orange pies.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein:
\[ \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein:
\[ \text{Yards used by grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ \text{Total yards used} = \text{Yards used by Mariah} + \text{Yards used by grandma} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is 273 yards.

answer:  To determine the length of the couch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the width of the rug.
2. Use the width of the rug to find the length of the couch.

**Step 1: Find the width of the rug.**

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, we calculate the width of the rug as follows:
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Use the width of the rug to find the length of the couch.**

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, we calculate the length of the couch as follows:
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the couch is \boxed{18} feet long.

answer:  Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \).

According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by all three is 43, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{3B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ \frac{3B}{2} = 36 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 3B = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 24 \]

So, Bodhi found 24 insects. Lily found:
\[ \frac{24}{2} + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 \]

answer:  To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost and number of sticks he can get from each type of wood.

1. **2 x 4 piece of wood:**
   - Cost per piece: $4
   - Number of sticks per piece: 200 sticks
   - Total cost for 6 pieces: $4 * 6 = $24
   - Total sticks for 6 pieces: 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks

2. **2 x 8 piece of wood:**
   - Cost per piece: $6
   - Number of sticks per piece: 400 sticks
   - Total cost for 4 pieces: $6 * 4 = $24
   - Total sticks for 4 pieces: 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

Since Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy 6 pieces of the 2 x 4 type of wood. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.

answer:  To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her weekly bus trips.

Janet takes two bus trips per day for five days a week:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \]

Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of her weekly bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \) dollars.

Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \) dollars.

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2.

She bought one pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry gum, grape gum, and green apple gum:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

answer:  Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

answer:  Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Therefore, we have:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

From these equations, we can solve for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ O + P = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of cows on the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
- Therefore, the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.

Next, let's determine the number of sheep on the farm:
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
- Therefore, the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total is \( 30 + 10 = 40 \) animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total is \( 60 + 20 = 80 \) animals.

Finally, let's find the combined number of animals on the farm and the zoo:
- The combined total is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \) animals.

answer:  Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th, which is 7 months away from December 31st. 

First, let's calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- December has 31 days.
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days.
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.

Adding these up:
31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 212 days

Andy needs to lose 30 pounds in 212 days. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Andy needs to burn:
105,000 calories / 212 days = 500 calories per day

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500:

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes.

Next, we find out how much money she has left after buying the clothes:

\[ \text{Remaining money after clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Now, let's calculate how much she spent on CDs. She spent 25% of the remaining $400:

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs.

Finally, we find out how much money she has left after buying the CDs:

\[ \text{Remaining money after CDs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

\[ \boxed{300} \]

answer:  To determine Tara's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags:
- Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags at $4 each.
- Each pack contains 5 bags, so 8 packs * 5 bags per pack = 40 bags.
- The total cost is 40 bags * $4 per pack = $160.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:
- Tara sold each bag for $8.
- She sold 40 bags, so the total revenue is 40 bags * $8 per bag = $320.

Finally, let's find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $320 - $160
- Profit = $160

Therefore, Tara earned $160 in profit on her bags.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Convert the total distance to kilometers.
3. Calculate the amount of water needed based on the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run:
- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- She needs to run 8 laps.

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Next, we convert the total distance to kilometers:
- Total distance = 2 km

Now, we calculate the amount of water needed based on the total distance:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- She runs 2 kilometers.

Water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ 3L = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost \(90,000\).

2. Calculate double Rob's time.
3. Add 40 minutes to double Rob's time to find Royce's time.

First, let's convert Rob's time from hours to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate double Rob's time:
\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add 40 minutes to double Rob's time to find Royce's time:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

- On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.
- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
- On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.

First, calculate the total number of problems completed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]

Next, find the number of problems remaining after Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

Now, calculate the number of problems completed on Wednesday:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

Then, find the total number of problems completed by Wednesday:
\[ 12 + 36 + 13 = 61 \]

Finally, calculate the number of problems remaining for Thursday:
\[ 100 - 61 = 39 \]

So, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein (for one pair)
- Socks: 2 skeins (for one pair)

Total wool for one grandchild:

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the wool for one grandchild by 3:
\[ 21 \text{ skeins/grandchild} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren} = 63 \text{ skeins} \]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

answer:  First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so he picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so she picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so he picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked by all four:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

answer:  To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of raisins used for one batch of oatmeal cookies.
2. Divide the total amount of raisins in the bag by the amount used for one batch.

First, let's calculate the amount of raisins used for one batch of oatmeal cookies:
\[ \text{Raisins per batch} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ cups} \]

Next, we divide the total amount of raisins in the bag by the amount used for one batch:
\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} \]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
\[ \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times 1.3333 = 36 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

answer:  To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for both red and blue tulips separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for red tulips = 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for blue tulips = 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for both red and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = Number of rows for red tulips + Number of rows for blue tulips
- Total number of rows = 6 rows + 3 rows = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

answer:  Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
Before adding, her daily consumption is 12 kWh/day * 7 days/week = 84 kWh/week.
Her weekly electric bill before adding the device is 84 kWh/week * $1.50/kWh = $126.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will increase by 2 kWh/day.
Her new daily consumption will be 12 kWh/day + 2 kWh/day = 14 kWh/day.
Her new weekly consumption after adding the device will be 14 kWh/day * 7 days/week = 98 kWh/week.
Her weekly electric bill after adding the device will be 98 kWh/week * $1.50/kWh = $147.

The difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $147 - $126 = $21.

answer:  To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the headphone set.
2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount Tom paid to find the cost of the CD.
3. Determine how much money Tom would have had left if he hadn't bought the headphone set.
4. Calculate how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.

Let's assume the cost of the headphone set is $40.

1. The cost of the headphone set is $40.
2. The total amount Tom paid is $48, so the cost of the CD is $48 - $40 = $8.
3. If Tom hadn't bought the headphone set, he would have had $48 - $40 = $8 left.
4. Since each CD costs $4, Tom would have been able to buy $8 / $4 = 2 more CDs.

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy **2 more CDs** if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

answer:  Let's calculate the number of passengers on the bus step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers:**
   \[
   48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
   - 5 times as many passengers as the number who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus.
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, after the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]

answer:  First, let's determine the number of chairs each person has.

Ophelia has 20 sofas, and since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ chairs} \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs each person has.

Ophelia has:
\[ 20 \text{ sofas} + 22 \text{ chairs} = 42 \text{ items} \]

Jenna has:
\[ 20 \text{ sofas} + 66 \text{ chairs} = 86 \text{ items} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:
\[ 42 \text{ items} + 86 \text{ items} = 128 \text{ items} \]

So, they have a total of 128 sofas and chairs.

1. For the first 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours each week:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For the next 2 weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. In the last 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, add up all the hours:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[

1. Identify the cost of the computer.
2. Determine the cost of the printer.
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer.
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent.
5. Divide the remaining amount by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

1. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
2. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount spent is $2,400, so the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. The cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, one monitor cost \boxed{300}.

answer:  Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had \( 2G \) candies.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has now is \( G - 5 \). We are told that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had:

\[ 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

answer:  If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, he is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Let's denote his cousin's current age as \( C \).

In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

In 8 years, his cousin will be \( C + 8 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age:
\[ C + 8 = 2 \times 30 - 5 \]
\[ C + 8 = 60 - 5 \]
\[ C + 8 = 55 \]
\[ C = 47 \]

So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old.

The difference in their ages is:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of years that separate their ages now is 25 years.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys and each boy brought 60 seashells:

\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seashells the girls brought. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:

\[ 600 + 4 \times 600 = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \]

Since there are 10 girls and they brought a total of 3000 seashells, we can find out how many seashells each girl brought by dividing the total number of seashells by the number of girls:

\[ \frac{3000}{10} = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

\[ \boxed{300} \]

answer:  First, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:

\[ \text{Tip} = 20\% \times \$50 = 0.20 \times \$50 = \$10 \]

Next, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount to be paid:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \$50 + \$10 = \$60 \]

Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, divide the total amount by 2:

\[ \text{Your share} = \frac{\$60}{2} = \$30 \]

Therefore, you end up paying \$30.

answer:  To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \( 2 \times 31 = 62 \) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:

\[ 31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm} \]

\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, determine Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we calculate:

Next, subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she needs to make in a month:
\[ 72 \text{ vlogs} - 54 \text{ vlogs} = 18 \text{ vlogs} \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make an additional 18 vlogs to complete her 72 vlogs per month.

answer:  To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for both Jairus and Jenny and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.
- Jairus completed 20 tasks.
- Jairus's total earnings = $0.8/task * 20 tasks = $<<0.8*20=16>>16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.
- Jenny completed 20 tasks.
- Jenny's total earnings = $0.5/task * 20 tasks = $<<0.5*20=10>>10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's total earnings = $16
- Jenny's total earnings = $10
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $<<16-10=6>>6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

answer:  Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of April as he does in the first half.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of April will be \( 15x \).
The total savings for the second half of April will be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the entire month will be \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, so \( 45x = 1125 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars each day in the second half of April.

The answer is $50 per day.

answer:  Let's start by determining how much money each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, each boy initially received $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Then, he added another $10 the following day:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Now, the eldest boy had $21.

He spent $8 from his total:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After spending $8, he had $13 left.

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. Since he had $13 left, tripling that amount gives:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

So, the final amount of money the eldest boy has is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]

- Oranges: 5 oranges × $0.80/orange = $<<5*0.80=4.00>>4.00
- Peaches: 6 peaches × $0.75/peach = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50

Next, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $<<4.50+4.00+4.50=13.00>>13.00

Verna gave $20. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

Change = $20 - $13.00 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

Therefore, Verna received $7.00 in change.

answer:  To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.**

Jeff's work is 3 miles away, and he walks to work and back each day. Therefore, the total distance he walks in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week.**

Jeff works 5 days a week. Therefore, the total distance he walks in one week is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money they are dividing is $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

1. **Writing the full alphabet twice:**
   - The full alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice means she writes \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet has \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing it once means she writes \( 13 \times 1 = 13 \) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written 52 letters (from the full alphabet) + 13 letters (from half of the alphabet) = 65 letters.
   - Re-writing everything means she writes \( 65 \times 2 = 130 \) letters.

Now, we add up all the letters she has written:

\[ 52 + 13 + 130 = 195 \]

So, Elise has written a total of 195 letters.

answer:  Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so Jonathan's play set should have:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach 400 toys, we can set up the following equation:
\[ J + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ J = 400 - 2 \]
\[ J = 398 \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

1. Hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 per hamburger = $<<5*4=20>>20
2. Potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 per pack = $<<10*0.30=3>>3
3. Fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 per can = $<<5*2=10>>10

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $20 (hamburgers) + $3 (potato fries) + $10 (fruit drinks) = $<<20+3+10=33>>33

Carly gives one fifty-dollar bill, which is $50. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

Change = $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17

Therefore, Carly gets $17 in change.

answer:  To find Mark's initial weight, we need to determine the total weight loss over the 3 months and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

His final weight was 70 pounds. Therefore, his initial weight was:
\[ 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator: 1 * $12 = $12
- One geometry set: 1 * $10 = $10

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

answer:  To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has.
2. Determine the total number of water bottles needed for the party.
3. Find the difference between the bottles needed and the bottles Bill currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has:
- Bill has 2 cases of water.
- Each case contains 24 bottles.
- Total bottles Bill has = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.

Next, let's determine the total number of water bottles needed for the party:
- Bill has 70 guests.
- He wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest.
- Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.

Finally, let's find the difference between the bottles needed and the bottles Bill currently has:
- Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Total bottles Bill has
- Additional bottles needed = 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles.

1. Calculate John's daily earnings.
2. Calculate John's weekly earnings.
3. Determine how many weeks it will take to save $80.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings:
John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day.
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$2/\text{hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} = \$10/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate John's weekly earnings:
John works 4 days a week.
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$10/\text{day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = \$40/\text{week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take to save $80:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$80}{\$40/\text{week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.

answer:  To calculate Antonella's commission for selling goods worth $2500, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the commission on the first $1000 in sales and the commission on the remaining $1500.

1. **Commission on the first $1000:**
   - Antonella earns a 30% commission on the first $1000 in sales.
   - Commission on $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. **Commission on the remaining $1500:**
   - Antonella earns a 10% commission on the remaining $1500 in sales.
   - Commission on $1500 = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the remaining $1500
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission.

answer:  On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
On a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long, which means he swims a mile in 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.
To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day, we need to calculate the total time for each scenario and then find the difference.

On a cold day:
Time to swim 3 miles = 3 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 48 minutes.

On a warm day:
Time to swim 3 miles = 3 miles * 34 minutes/mile = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is:
102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a warm day than on a cold day.

answer:  First, we need to determine the daily recommended cups of coffee. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks:
\[ \frac{R}{2} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks:
\[ 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \]

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5R = 4 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \]

So, the daily recommended cups of coffee is 0.8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. He currently drinks 4 cups and needs to reduce it to 0.8 cups. The reduction is:
\[ 4 - 0.8 = 3.2 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 3.2 \) cups.

answer:  To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Given:
- The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
- The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

First, calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} \]
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

- Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Therefore, the size of Zack's locker is:
  \[
  \text{Size of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
  \]

Next, let's find the size of Peter's locker:
- Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker.
- Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches.
- Therefore, the size of Peter's locker is:
  \[
  \text{Size of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
  \]

Thus, Peter's locker is \( \boxed{3} \) cubic inches.

answer:  To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine their individual weights.

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we find the average weight by dividing the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

answer:  To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles needed for each son.
2. Determine the total number of candles needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the candles.

1. The older son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, he needs 8 candles.
3. The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.
4. Each pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
   \]
5. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

answer:  To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters/cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ guinea pigs/cage} = 15 \text{ guinea pigs}
  \]

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
\[
30 \text{ hamsters} + 15 \text{ guinea pigs} = 45 \text{ rodents}
\]

Therefore, the pet shop has 45 rodents.

answer:  To determine the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider both the initial angle of the pyramid and the angle increase due to the sun's movement.

1. **Initial Angle of the Pyramid:**
   The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Angle Increase Due to Sun's Movement:**
   The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the angle increase is:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Total Angle from the Ground to the Sun:**
   To find the total angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle increase due to the sun's movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, after 10 hours, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be \( 82 \) degrees.

answer:  To determine how many sandwiches are left after Cody and Trevor ate some, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches Cody ate.
2. Calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate.
3. Add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.
4. Subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the number of sandwiches Cody ate:
\[ \text{Sandwiches Cody ate} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate:
\[ \text{Sandwiches Trevor ate} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, let's add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:
\[ \text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Finally, subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:
\[ \text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( \boxed{5} \).

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to sum up the amounts received for each group of teeth lost.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each:
   \[
   3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, she received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that amount is:
   \[
   \frac{\$1.00}{2} = \$0.50
   \]
   Therefore, she received:
   \[
   2 \times \$0.50 = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00.

answer:  In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days, so she read a total of 15 minutes/day * 7 days = 105 minutes.
If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, then in 105 minutes she can read 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 pages.
In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.
Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is 70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages.

answer:  Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \).

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old} \]

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

answer:  To determine the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to find out how many goals each person scored and then sum them up.

1. **Richie's goals**: Richie scored 80 goals.
2. **Mark's goals**: Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, Mark scored:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. **Anna's goals**: Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, Anna scored:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we sum up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

All three teenagers scored 175 goals.

answer:  Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Therefore, he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 each day for 3 days, so he spends a total of $10 * 3 = $30 on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so he can buy $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he spends $10 each day for 4 days, so he spends a total of $10 * 4 = $40 on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we add the number of wooden action figures and the number of plastic action figures:

6 wooden action figures + 20 plastic action figures = 26 action figures

Therefore, Peter will have a total of 26 action figures by the end of the week.

answer:  To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes in 2 years.
2. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Katina removes in 2 years:

- Katina removes $100 every month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, in 2 years, there are \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.
- The total amount removed in 2 years is \( 100 \times 24 = 2400 \) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:

- Initial amount: $3000
- Total amount removed: $2400
- Remaining amount: \( 3000 - 2400 = 600 \) dollars

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining.

answer:  To determine how much money Kate can make from selling her crayon muffins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small pieces of crayons Kate has.
2. Determine how many muffins she can make.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins.

First, let's find the total number of small pieces of crayons:
- Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each.
- Total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.

Next, we need to determine how many muffins she can make:
- Each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons.
- Number of muffins = Total crayons / Crayons per muffin = 192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins:
- Each muffin sells for $1.50.
- Total revenue = Number of muffins * Price per muffin = 24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.

Therefore, Kate can make $36.

answer:  To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops per week.
3. Find the difference between the number of roses grown and the number of roses ordered per week.
4. Multiply the weekly deficit by 4 (assuming a month has 4 weeks) to find the monthly deficit.

1. **Roses grown per week:**
   Ford grows 40 roses every week.

2. **Roses ordered per week:**
   - First flower shop: 20 roses
   - Second flower shop: 15 roses
   - Third flower shop: 30 roses

   Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

3. **Weekly deficit:**
   Weekly deficit = 65 roses - 40 roses = 25 roses

4. **Monthly deficit:**
   Monthly deficit = 25 roses * 4 weeks = 100 roses

answer:  To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the total costs.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
- Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

Next, let's calculate the total costs:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- Total cost of bread = $3.00 * 10 sandwiches = $30.00.
- The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.
- Total cost of cheeses and condiments = $30.00.
- Total costs = $30.00 + $30.00 = $60.00.

Finally, let's calculate the net profit:
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs
- Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00 = $10.00.

answer:  To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the number of birds he saw each day:
- Day 1: 50 birds
- Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4: 120 birds
- Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total birds = 470 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7) to find the average:
Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average birds per day = 470 birds / 7 days
Average birds per day = 70 birds per day

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 70 birds in a day.

answer:  First, calculate the area of Michael's bedroom: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- Cost of new carpet: $12 per square foot * 216 square feet = $2592
- Cost of padding: $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432

Then, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
- Cost to remove old carpet: $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864

Finally, calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
- Cost to install new carpet: $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7344

Add up all the costs to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of new carpet + Cost of padding + Cost to remove old carpet + Cost to install new carpet
- Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
- Total cost = $11,332

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: The starting value is 20.

2. **First Operation**: Add the starting value to half of the starting value.
   - Half of the starting value: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
   - Add the starting value: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \)

3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result by 5.
   - Divide by 5: \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \)

4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result by the starting value and subtract 12.
   - Multiply by the starting value: \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \)
   - Subtract 12: \( 120 - 12 = 108 \)

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 108.

answer:  To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert both movie durations to minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie to minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the duration of the second movie to minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 2 * 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie)
- Total time = 215 minutes.

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 64 dishes.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy is 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.
The total number of utensils brought by her friend is 40 cups + 64 dishes = 104 utensils.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is 36 + 104 = 140 utensils.

answer:  To determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we first need to find the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature.

Set temperature: 450 degrees
Actual temperature: 468 degrees

Difference: 468 - 450 = 18 degrees

Next, we calculate the percentage off:

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
Percentage off = (18 / 450) * 100
Percentage off = 0.04 * 100
Percentage off = 4%

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we need to adjust the temperature for the recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

Required temperature = 520 degrees
Percentage off = 4%

Adjusted temperature = Required temperature + (Required temperature * Percentage off)
Adjusted temperature = 520 + (520 * 0.04)
Adjusted temperature = 520 + 20
Adjusted temperature = 540 degrees

Maggie should set her oven to 540 degrees.

answer:  First, let's calculate Jill's earnings:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday at $10 per hour: 2 hours × $10/hour = $20
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday at $10 per hour: 1 hour × $10/hour = $10
- Total earnings for Jill: $20 + $10 = $30

Next, let's calculate John's earnings:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday: 2 × 2 hours = 4 hours
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday: 3 × 1 hour = 3 hours
- John worked 4 hours on Saturday at $10 per hour: 4 hours × $10/hour = $40
- John worked 3 hours on Sunday at $10 per hour: 3 hours × $10/hour = $30
- Total earnings for John: $40 + $30 = $70

Finally, let's find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings: $70 - $30 = $40

answer:  Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).

The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B - 0.99B = 150 \]

Therefore, there are 150 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

answer:  First, calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts:
- Original price: $100.00
- Discount: 10% of $100.00 = $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00
- Discounted price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
- Total cost for 2 boxes: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Now, calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:
- Each box contains 90 contacts.
- Total contacts in 2 boxes: 90 * 2 = 180 contacts

Finally, calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
- Total cost for 2 boxes: $180.00
- Total contacts in 2 boxes: 180
- Cost per pair: $180.00 / 180 = $1.00

So, each pair of contacts will cost $1.00.

answer:  First, calculate the total calories burned during each activity:

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Next, add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, determine how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories:

Number of 200 calorie sets = 1600 calories / 200 calories per set = 8 sets

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, multiply the number of sets by the amount of water needed per set:

Total water needed = 8 sets * 100 ml per set = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

answer:  To determine the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will lose \( 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will gain \( 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks will be 2.5 pounds.

answer:  To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weight of each dog step by step.

1. **Affenpinscher:**
   - The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund:**
   - The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   - Therefore, the Dachshund's weight is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pounds.

3. **Papillon:**
   - The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   - Therefore, the Papillon's weight is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pounds.

4. **Mastiff:**
   - The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   - Therefore, the Mastiff's weight is \( 44 \times 5 = 220 \) pounds.

So, the weight of the Mastiff is:

\[ \boxed{220 \text{ pounds}} \]

Thus, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

answer:  To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial typing speed.
2. Identify the second typing speed after the increase.
3. Calculate the third typing speed after the second increase.
4. Sum the three measurements.
5. Divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average.

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. Second typing speed: 52 WPM
3. Third typing speed: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, sum the three measurements:
\[ 47 \, \text{WPM} + 52 \, \text{WPM} + 57 \, \text{WPM} = 156 \, \text{WPM} \]

Finally, divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156 \, \text{WPM}}{3} = 52 \, \text{WPM} \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

2. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends, so:
   \[
   100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ additional friends}

3. Alex calls 10 friends to invite them.
4. 8 of these 10 friends will bring their spouses, so:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ spouses}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the people:
\[
100 \text{ invited people} + 200 \text{ additional friends} + 10 \text{ friends} + 16 \text{ spouses} = 326 \text{ people}
\]

Since Alex herself is also attending the event, we need to add 1 to the total:

1. **Day 1:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
2. **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles its height, so it is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
3. **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
4. **Day 4:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.
5. **Day 5:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) feet tall.
6. **Day 6:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(64 \times 2 = 128\) feet tall.

On Day 6, the beanstalk exceeds 20 feet, which is taller than Mark's window.

answer:  Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2(J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

answer:  To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com, we need to calculate the total cost for both platforms and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost on Amazon.com:
- Cost of the boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon.com: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost on eBay:
- Cost of the boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice as much as on Amazon.com, so 2 * $4 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.com:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon.com: $20
- Difference in cost: $21 - $20 = $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon.com.

answer:  Let the smallest angle in the triangle be \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

Now, we can find the measures of the other angles:
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is the third angle, which is 90 degrees.

#### 90 degrees.

answer:  To find the total number of legs for all the pets in the store, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - There are 5 dogs.
   - Total legs for dogs = 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs.

2. **Cats:**
   - Each cat has 4 legs.
   - There are 2 cats.
   - Total legs for cats = 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs.

3. **Birds:**
   - Each bird has 2 legs.
   - There are 10 birds.
   - Total legs for birds = 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 48.

**Answer: 48**

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

1. Base price of one implant: $2000
2. Cost of the crown for one implant: $500
3. Total cost for one implant: $2000 + $500 = $2500
4. Total cost for two implants: $2500 * 2 = $5000
5. Cost of the crown for the second implant: $500
6. Total cost of the dental work: $5000 + $500 = $5500

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

$5500 - $600 = $4900

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $4900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

$4900 / $15/hour = 320 hours

Therefore, George needs to work 320 hours to pay for the dental work.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has:

- Quarters: 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15

Adding these amounts together:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Colby has $3.45. Since each gumball costs a nickel (which is $0.05), we can find out how many gumballs he can buy by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 / $0.05 per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. The answer is 69 gumballs.

answer:  Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, so he makes 120/2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in one hour.
Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours, so she makes (3/4) * 120 = 45 pounds of chocolates in one hour.
If they worked for 12 hours in a day, Ruiz made 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.
Marissa made 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.
Together, they made 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates.

answer:  To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new weight after a 50% increase.
2. Adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the increased weight.

First, let's find the new weight after a 50% increase:

\[ \text{Original weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 0.5 \times 8 \text{ pounds} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{New weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the new weight:

\[ \text{Final weight} = 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

answer:  To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to find the plane's speed.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Here, the additional distance is 2000 miles and the speed is 400 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

answer:  First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour for 4 hours.
- The price per cup is $0.50.
- Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours.
- The price per cup is $0.60.
- Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for all six hours:
- Total earnings = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

Therefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. According to the directions, 2 pumps are used for 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of pumps is:

\[ 2 \text{ pumps} \times 120 \text{ washings} = 240 \text{ pumps} \]

Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, so she will use all 240 pumps. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{240 \text{ pumps}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

To convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 10 cents.

answer:  Let's break down Howard's spending step by step:

1. **Monday:** Howard spends $8.
2. **Tuesday:** He spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's spending} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Wednesday:** He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's spending} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total spending over the three days:
\[
\text{Total spending} = 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract his total spending from his original amount:
\[
\text{Money left} = 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

Since each tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per year is:
\[ 4800 \text{ miles/year} \times 725 \text{ rotations/mile} = 33600000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Each tire can withstand 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years the tire will last before needing to be replaced, we divide the total rotations the tire can withstand by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{3,480,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 3 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after approximately 3 years.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen croissants.
2. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants.
3. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants per day.
4. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants for a week (7 days).

1. The amount of butter needed for 1 dozen croissants is 1/4 pound.
2. The amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants is 4 * (1/4) = 4/4 = 1 pound.
3. The amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants per day is 1 pound.
4. The amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants for a week is 1 pound per day * 7 days = 7 pounds.

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

answer:  John received initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. His research took 10 times as long, so it took 10 * 5 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, he received $100,000 per month, so the total cost for those months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 45 months, he received 50% more funding per month. This means he received $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Therefore, the total cost of his research is $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

John's research cost $7,250,000.

answer:  First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
- The original price of the shirt is $25.
- There is a 30% discount.
- The discount amount is 30% of $25, which is \( 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \).
- Therefore, the discounted price of the shirt is \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt and the shorts:
- The discounted price of the shirt is $17.50.
- The price of the shorts is $35.
- The total cost is \( 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \).

Finally, let's determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase:
- Joe starts with $50.
- The total cost is $52.50.
- The amount of money left is \( 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \).

Joe will owe $2.50 after the purchase.

answer:  To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the total cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,460.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = $95,460 - $29,100 = $66,360.

Therefore, it costs $66,360 more to repave Lewis' street than to repave Monica's street.

answer:  To find the total number of posts made by the Reddit group in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts made by one member in March.
3. Calculate the total number of posts made by all members in March.

1. March has 31 days.
2. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Therefore, the total number of posts made by one member in March is:
   \[
   3 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93 \text{ posts/member}
   \]
3. There are 1000 members in the group. Therefore, the total number of posts made by all members in March is:
   \[
   93 \text{ posts/member} \times 1000 \text{ members} = 93,000 \text{ posts}
   \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000.

She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each, so she spent 2 * $2.50 = $<<2*2.50=5.00>>5.00 on rocks.
She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece, so she spent 3 * $2.00 = $<<3*2.00=6.00>>6.00 on coral.
She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, so she spent 20 * $0.50 = $<<20*0.50=10.00>>10.00 on fish.
She needed fish food that cost $2.00.

answer:  To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, with 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

First, let's convert the one-pound steak to ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, a one-pound steak is:
\[ 1 \text{ pound} \times 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up all the ounces of meat consumed:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces (first player)} + 8 \text{ ounces (second player)} + 16 \text{ ounces (third player)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \]

answer:  To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total gallons of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water for the year.

First, let's calculate the total gallons of water used per week:
- Gary does laundry twice a week.
- Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- Total gallons per week = 2 loads/week * 20 gallons/load = 40 gallons/week.

Next, let's calculate the total gallons of water used per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total gallons per year = 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the water for the year:
- Each gallon of water costs $0.15.
- Total cost = 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.

So, the total amount of meat sold in one day is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \text{ kg}}{150 \text{ kg/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

answer:  To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights.
2. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, let's calculate the total number of street lights:
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- There are 4 intersections.

So, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:
- There are 20 non-functioning street lights.

So, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is \( \boxed{76} \).

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. Therefore, the height after the second week is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. Therefore, the height after the third week is:
   \[
   6 + 4 = 10 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of seats in the auditorium:
\[ 4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we find the number of remaining seats after the administrators are seated:
\[ 72 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, we determine the number of seats occupied by the students:
\[ 54 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 36 \text{ seats} \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ 36 \text{ students} \]

answer:  To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours of physical therapy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.

1. **Total number of sessions:**
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he went twice, so 2 sessions per week.
   - Total sessions = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions.

2. **Total number of hours of physical therapy:**
   - Each session lasted 2 hours.
   - Total hours = 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The hourly rate is $125 per hour.
   - Total cost = 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

answer:  To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we first need to find her current age. We know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

Next, we need to find her age 4 years from now. Since she is currently 4 years old, adding 4 years to her current age:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

answer:  Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school for 8 hours:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]
So, after chewing these 4 pieces at school, he has:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 4 \text{ pieces} = 16 \text{ pieces} \]

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner:
\[ 16 \text{ pieces} - 2 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]
So, after giving 7 pieces to his sister, he has:
\[ 14 \text{ pieces} - 7 \text{ pieces} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Jim has \( 7 \) pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, calculate the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days. Since the truck towed four fewer cars each day than the first three days, it towed:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to find the total number of cars towed in the week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]

answer:  To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes (kb) per second to megabytes (Mb) per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that:
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

So, to convert 20 kb per second to Mb per second:
\[ 20 \text{ kb/second} \times \frac{1 \text{ Mb}}{1000 \text{ kb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \]

Next, we need to convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 7.2 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount the company paid to acquire the cars:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total selling price} - \text{Amount paid} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit:
\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \text{ of } \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, James made:

answer:  To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each jewel and then sum them up.

1. The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold Jewell is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
   \[
   \text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum up the prices of all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height Adam needs to grow.
3. Determine how many years it will take for him to grow that additional height.

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches:
   \[

   \]

3. Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches at a rate of 2 inches per year:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

First, calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, determine how many of these riders are women:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]

Finally, subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

answer:  To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them.

First, let's find the relative speed between Tom and Bob:
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap at a relative speed of 15 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

answer:  To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then find the maximum number of classes he can miss while not exceeding the $10 per class limit.

1. Total cost of the classes: $60
2. Total number of classes: 10
3. Maximum cost per class: $10

First, let's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit:

\[ \text{Maximum number of classes} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Maximum cost per class}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

So, Manny can attend 6 classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Next, we calculate the number of classes he can miss:

\[ \text{Number of classes he can miss} = \text{Total number of classes} - \text{Maximum number of classes} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents don't sign him up again.

answer:  To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   - Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   - Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
   - Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
   - Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   - Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
   - Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
   - Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10

Now, we sum up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps:
- Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
- Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
- Total number of stamps = 45

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.

\boxed{45}

answer:  Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as \( L \) miles.

According to the problem:
- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.
- Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran \( L + 3 \) miles.

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

answer:  To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their daily production rates and then extend that to a weekly basis.

1. **Jewel's Daily Production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Julie's Daily Production:**
   - Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

3. **Combined Daily Production:**
   - Total daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
   - Total daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day

4. **Total Weekly Production:**
   - They work all days of the week, which is 7 days.
   - Total weekly production = Total daily production \(\times\) Number of days in a week
   - Total weekly production = 150 customers/day \(\times\) 7 days = 1050 customers/week

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel if they work all days of the week is 1050 customers.

The cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4} = \$1.30 \]

The cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 apples:
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30 = \$6.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50 \]

Finally, let's find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \( \$12.00 \) for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

\[ \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, he receives a bonus worth half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

Adding the bonus to his new monthly salary:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Now, let's calculate his annual earnings:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $372,000 in a year after the promotion.

answer:  To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the first website:
- The first website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the first website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the second website:
- The second website publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the second website = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
- Total articles by both websites = 560 articles (first website) + 280 articles (second website) = 840 articles.

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is:

answer:  To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the costs of all the additional features to the base price of the truck.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third of the king cab upgrade, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \)
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \)
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, add all these costs together:

\[ 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500 \]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

The final answer is:

- Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/pant = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Total cost for dress shirts = 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit * $60/shirt = $1800.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

answer:  To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags.

First, we know that each bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, since we have three bags, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \text{ kg/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet/hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the speed of soil through clay, so his rate through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Finally, add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay to find the total time:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

answer:  To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Steve's Age**: Steve is 60 years old.
2. **Wife's Age**: Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve.
   \[
   \text{Wife's age} = \text{Steve's age} + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. **Son's Age**: Their son is currently half as old as his mom.
   \[
   \text{Son's age} = \frac{\text{Wife's age}}{2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. **Son's Wife's Age**: Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.
   \[
   \text{Son's wife's age} = \text{Son's age} - 3 = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

answer:  To determine the total number of Instagram likes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of likes.
2. Calculate the number of likes after three weeks.
3. Add the new likes received recently.
4. Sum the total number of likes.

1. The initial number of likes is 2000.
2. After three weeks, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of likes after three weeks is 140000.
3. She received 20000 more new likes recently.
4. To find the total number of likes, we add the initial number of likes, the number of likes after three weeks, and the new likes:
   \[
   2000 + 140000 + 20000 = 162000
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 162,000.

answer:  First, let's determine the sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400 and this is half of the sales from green hats, we can calculate the sales from green hats as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount she made in two months:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100. #### 2100

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for Clara on Tuesday:
- She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is 20 * $20 = $400.
- She received a $2 discount, so her final cost is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Sheila on Wednesday:
- She bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost before the discount is 20 * $30 = $600.
- She received a 10% discount, so the discount amount is $600 * 0.10 = $60.
- Her final cost after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
- Clara's final price: $398
- Sheila's final price: $540
- The difference is $540 - $398 = $142

answer:  To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally has received this week.
2. Subtract the expected wage from the total amount received to find out how much was withheld.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sally has received this week:

Sally's bank account started with $200 and ended with $420. Therefore, the amount of money she has received is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that Sally's weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the expected wage from the total amount received:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

answer:  James hires the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for the remaining 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each hour:
1. First hour: $15
2. Second hour: 2 * $15 = $30
3. Third hour: 2 * $30 = $60
4. Fourth hour: 2 * $60 = $120

Now, let's sum up the costs for the 4 hours:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60
- Fourth hour: $120

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 + $120 = $225

Therefore, James paid $225.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine how many whole eggs are required to make those deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the total number of whole eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 16 guests * 3 halves/guest = 48 halves.

Next, we find out how many whole eggs are required to make those deviled egg halves:
- Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
- Total whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

Finally, we convert the total number of whole eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

answer:  To calculate the total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly maintenance costs.

1. **Initial cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rent**: $5000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice as much as the hanger rent, so it's 2 * $5000 = $10000

First, let's calculate the total monthly cost:
- Hanger rent: $5000
- Fuel cost: $10000
- Total monthly cost: $5000 + $10000 = $15000

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:
- Initial cost: $150,000
- Total monthly cost for 12 months: $15000 * 12 = $180,000

Total cost: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

answer:  To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to read.
2. Determine how many days it will take for Mike to read the book.
3. Subtract the number of days he will take to read the book from the total number of days available.

1. The total number of pages in the book is 200.
2. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:
   \[
   \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]
3. The deadline is 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we subtract the number of days it will take him to read the book from the deadline:
   \[
   30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

answer:  Let's break down the cooking times step by step:

1. **Cooking time for rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook rice.

2. **Cooking time for pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Therefore, it took \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes to cook pork.

3. **Cooking time for beans:**
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time for pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, it took \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes to cook beans.

4. **Total cooking time:**
   - Time for rice: 30 minutes
   - Time for pork: 50 minutes
   - Time for beans: 40 minutes
   - Total cooking time: \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes

So, it took a total of 120 minutes to cook all the food.

answer:  To determine how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of newspapers James delivers in a day.
2. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A.
3. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District C.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total newspapers delivered in a day: 600
2. Newspapers delivered to District A: 198
3. Newspapers delivered to District C: 209

First, subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A from the total:
\[ 600 - 198 = 402 \]

Next, subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District C from the remaining total:
\[ 402 - 209 = 193 \]

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week (7 days), so he needs:

\[ \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The total cost for 7 pounds of coffee is:

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of animal legs:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]
2. The total number of animal heads:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = 20 - S
\]

Next, substitute \( G = 20 - S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
\]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
\]
\[
2S + 40 = 70
\]

Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
2S = 30
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15} \).

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought excluding the apple pie.

1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each:
   \[
   2 \times 2.00 = 4.00
   \]

2. He bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00:
   \[
   8.00
   \]

3. He bought a bottle of soda for $1.00:
   \[
   1.00
   \]

Now, let's add up the costs of these items:
\[
4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each sleeps:

\[ \text{Total time sleeping} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class over 6 weeks:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, divide the total number of hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:

\[ 48 \text{ hours} \div 1.5 \text{ hours/recipe} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes.

answer:  First, determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

Finally, divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much each person would get if they share it equally:

\[ \text{Each gets} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he received is:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam received $4 in change.

answer:  To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = Flour + Sugar + Salt
Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 tablespoons + 3 tablespoons + 0.25 tablespoons
Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, for 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = Total dry ingredients for one muffin * 16
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 8.25 tablespoons * 16
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of management employees. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

answer:  First, we need to find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert's candy: 3 pounds
Cindy's candy: 5 pounds
Aaron's candy: 4 pounds

Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Next, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people to find out how much each person would get.

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = 12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

answer:  James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he has 4 toys for 4 dogs = 4 toys.
There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so there are a total of 4 dogs + 8 dogs = 12 dogs.
Each dog needs one toy, so for 12 dogs, James needs 12 toys.
After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, so there are now 12 dogs + 2 * 8 dogs = 28 dogs.
Each dog needs one toy, so for 28 dogs, James needs 28 toys.
When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so there are now 28 dogs - 3 dogs = 25 dogs.
Each dog needs one toy, so for 25 dogs, James needs 25 toys.
In total, James needs 4 toys + 12 toys + 28 toys + 25 toys = 69 toys.

answer:  To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to account for the given information and calculate the remaining good days.

1. **Total days in the month:** 30 days
2. **Good days:** 12 days
3. **Bad days:** 8 days
4. **Neutral days:** 30 days - 12 - 8 = 10 days
5. **First 8 days:** Good
6. **Second 8 days:** Bad
7. **Third 8 days:** Neutral
8. **Next 3 days:** Good, Neutral, Good

Let's break down the good days:
- First 8 days: Good
- Next 3 days: Good, Neutral, Good (3 good days)

Total good days accounted so far:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 3 days: 3 good days

Total good days accounted for: 8 + 3 = 11 good days

Since there were 12 good days in total, the number of good days left is:
12 - 11 = 1 good day

answer:  To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the initial height from feet to inches.
2. Determine the total growth needed.
3. Calculate the number of days required based on the growth rate.

1. Convert the initial height from feet to inches:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Determine the total growth needed:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of days required based on the growth rate:
   \[
   \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.

answer:  To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion based on the given information that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

Let \( x \) be the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

The proportion can be written as:
\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
6 \text{ potatoes} \times x \text{ hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}
\]
\[
6x = 3456
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 6:
\[
x = \frac{3456}{6}
\]
\[
x = 576
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

answer:  To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Determine the total number of signatures they need to reach their goal.
3. Subtract the current total from the goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

First, let's find the total number of signatures they currently have:
- Carol has 20 signatures.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total current signatures = 20 (Carol) + 44 (Jennifer) = 64 signatures.

Next, let's determine the total number of signatures they need to reach their goal:
- Their goal is 100 signatures between them.

Now, we subtract the current total from the goal to find out how many more signatures they need:
Signatures needed = Goal - Total current signatures
Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect \boxed{36} signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them.

Next, let's calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Now, let's determine how much Frances invested:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

Finally, let's calculate Skyler's investment:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 1200 - (480 + 480) = 1200 - 960 = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment was:
\[ \boxed{240} \]

answer:  To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time spent in each mode and then sum them up.

1. **Time in turtle mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in turtle mode in 1 hour.
   - Since he mowed half of the lawn in turtle mode, the time spent in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time in rabbit mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode in 40 minutes.
   - Since he mowed half of the lawn in rabbit mode, the time spent in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time:**
   - Add the time spent in turtle mode and rabbit mode:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

answer:  Let's start by determining how many cookies each person has based on the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}
   \]
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:
   \[
   73 + 23 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has:
\[
68 \text{ (Katarina)} + 73 \text{ (Max)} + 61 \text{ (Cookie Monster)} + 96 \text{ (Summer)} = 298 \text{ cookies}
\]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298.

answer:  First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Next, add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Let's assume Jack's weight is \( J \) kg.
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + J \text{ kg} \]

Now, determine how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load of the elevator:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + J \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} \]
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + J \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} \]
\[ J \text{ kg} - 660 \text{ kg} \]

Since Jack's weight \( J \) is not specified, the amount by which they exceed the maximum load will be \( J - 660 \) kg.

Therefore, the amount by which they exceed the maximum load of the elevator is \( J - 660 \) kg.

answer:  Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

First, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, the extended length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Next, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. So, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

answer:  Let's denote the age of one triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + 2(x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 7 + 2x + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 4x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 23 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 5.75 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 5.75 years. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

\[ x + 7 = 5.75 + 7 = 12.75 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 12.75 years old.

answer:  To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2 per kilo = $4

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3 per kilo = $6

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6
- Total cost = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

answer:  To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already walked from the total time they have.

First, let's calculate the total time they have already walked:
- Time to get to the corner: 6 minutes
- Time to get to the fire station: 13 minutes

Total time walked so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Next, we subtract the time they have already walked from the total time they have:
- Total time available: 30 minutes
- Time walked so far: 19 minutes

Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late.

answer:  To determine how many cookies are in the box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes.
2. Find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda.
3. Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes:
- Greta bakes 30 cookies.
- Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta.
- Therefore, Celinda bakes \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cookies.

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:
- Total cookies = Cookies baked by Greta + Cookies baked by Celinda
- Total cookies = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies

Finally, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked:
- Cookies in the box = Total cookies - Cookies eaten
- Cookies in the box = 90 - 10 = 80 cookies

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let \( T \) be the total bill including the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ 0.6T = 40 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.6} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100.

Now, let's add the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]

Finally, we subtract the total bill from the amount John brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00. Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's find the total time spent on homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total time spent on homework = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, let's convert the total time John has before dinner into minutes:
- 3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time he has before dinner:
- Total time before dinner: 180 minutes
- Time spent on homework: 80 minutes

Time for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

answer:  Rong saves 20 coins per month.
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5) * 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.
In one year, there are 12 months, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins in one year.
Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins in one year.
In ten years, Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.
Together, Rong and Neil have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

answer:  To determine the total square footage of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - There are 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up all the squares:
- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 18
- Green squares: 24
- White squares: 12

Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Therefore, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet in total.

answer:  To determine the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \]

Therefore, the price for the crate of fruit is \boxed{32}.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of regular chairs currently in the restaurant. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs needed} = \text{Number of adult chairs} + \text{Number of baby chairs} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs are required. Mia currently has 40 chairs, so the number of additional chairs needed is:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total number of chairs needed} - \text{Current chairs} = 57 - 40 = 17 \]

Mia needs 17 more chairs.

answer:  To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to find out how many pencils are currently in the box. 

Given:
- The box has space for 20 pencils.
- There are 4 pencils missing from the box.

So, the number of pencils currently in the box is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Thus, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

answer:  To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of grandchildren:**
   - Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
   - Each child has 3 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren is:
     \[
     3 \times 3 = 9
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of great-grandchildren:**
   - Each grandchild has 3 children.
   - There are 9 grandchildren.
   - Therefore, the total number of great-grandchildren is:
     \[
     9 \times 3 = 27
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of great grand-babies:**
   - Each great-grandchild has 3 babies.
   - There are 27 great-grandchildren.
   - Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies is:
     \[
     27 \times 3 = 81
     \]

Thus, there will be 81 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

1. Adam collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam:
   \[
   50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[

answer:  Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Retirement contribution} = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, after contributing to retirement, she has:

\[ \text{Remaining amount after retirement} = 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment.

\[ \text{Car payment} = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, after making the car payment, she has:

\[ \text{Remaining amount after car payment} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, after funding her retirement and paying for her car, Greta has $720 left to spend.

answer:  To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
3. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dumplings}
   \]
4. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
   \[
   8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dumplings}
   \]
5. The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is:
   \[
   18 + 32 = 50 \text{ dumplings}
   \]

Therefore, Larry cooked \(50\) dumplings.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people in the group:
- Aiden
- 12 friends
- 7 more friends

Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Next, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed. Each person requires:
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Total drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the drinks and snacks. Each drink and snack costs $2:

Total cost for drinks = 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Total cost for snacks = 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Finally, let's find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks:

Total amount spent = Total cost for drinks + Total cost for snacks
Total amount spent = $80 + $120 = $200

Therefore, the group has spent $200 on snacks and drinks.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks

Next, we need to find out how many of these fireworks Hannah will see. Since she can see 40% of the city's fireworks:

40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = <<0.40*300=120>>120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks

Finally, we add the fireworks she will see from the city and the fireworks she will set off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see:

120 fireworks (from the city) + 15 fireworks (from her backyard) = <<120+15=135>>135 fireworks

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks.

answer:  To determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
2. Subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck's capacity.

First, we know that Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry:
\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is:
\[ 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry:
\[ 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

\( \boxed{2800} \) pounds.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.
2. Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

First, let's find the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:
- Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
- 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 32\% \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
- The total water usage by Colorado City is 40%.
- 32% of that is used for industrial purposes.

So, the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

answer:  First, determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Distance is found by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

answer:  First, determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Next, calculate the value of one part:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, calculate how much each person received:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Julia's share} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book:
\[ \text{Gerald's remaining money} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left.

answer:  To determine how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal.
2. Determine the amount raised per hour.
3. Calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount.

First, find the remaining amount needed:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised so far} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, determine the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Amount raised so far}}{\text{Number of hours so far}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

answer:  To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops she buys, she only pays for 2 scoops.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so the cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy, we divide $6.00 by the cost of 2 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops. For each set, she gets 2 scoops and 1 free scoop, so for each set, she gets:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ scoops} \]

Since she buys 2 sets, she gets:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops.

answer:  First, let's determine the rate at which the factory makes each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Next, we calculate the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, we add the total amounts of both types of ice cream:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

answer:  To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new price per computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers.

First, let's calculate the new price per computer:

The original price per computer is $700. A 10% increase means the price increases by 10% of $700.

\[ \text{Increase} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price is:

\[ \$385,000 \]

answer:  To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total bathroom area.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for the calculated area.

First, let's find two-thirds of the total bathroom area:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 36 = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot. Therefore, the number of tiles needed for 24 square feet is:

\[
24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, to find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:

1. The cost to go on the picking trip is $20.
2. The cost per pound of blueberries is $1.5.
3. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

So, the total cost of picking the blueberries is:
\[ 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:

1. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
2. James bought 30 pounds of blueberries.

So, the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]

Now, let's find out how much James saved by subtracting the total cost of picking the blueberries from the total cost of buying them at the store:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

2. Calculate the total weight of the rice given to her brother.
3. Add the weights of the rice given to her cousin and brother.

First, let's calculate the weight of the rice given to her cousin:
- Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- Each sack weighs 25 kilograms.
- Total weight of rice given to cousin = 3 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 75 kg.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the rice given to her brother:
- Goldy gave 4 sacks to her brother.
- Each sack weighs 25 kilograms.
- Total weight of rice given to brother = 4 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 100 kg.

Now, we add the weights of the rice given to her cousin and brother:
- Total weight given to cousin and brother = 75 kg + 100 kg = 175 kg.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of one eraser is $0.25, and you bought 8 erasers:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, add the total cost of the pencils and erasers:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

Next, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change you would get is $5.00.

answer:  To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each component and then sum them up.

1. **Calories from eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. **Calories from cheese:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Calories from ham:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of ham.
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, add up the calories from all the components:
- Total calories = 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories

answer:  To determine how many people accept the position, we need to follow the steps outlined in the problem:

1. Calculate the number of people who receive interviews.
2. Calculate the number of people who receive a job offer.
3. Calculate the number of people who accept the position.

First, let's find the number of people who receive interviews:
- 100 people apply for the job.
- 30% of those who apply receive interviews.
- Number of people who receive interviews = 100 * 0.30 = 30.

Next, let's find the number of people who receive a job offer:
- 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer.
- Number of people who receive a job offer = 30 * 0.20 = 6.

Finally, let's find the number of people who accept the position:
- A third of those who receive a job offer accept the position.
- Number of people who accept the position = 6 * (1/3) = 2.

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

answer:  To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the original number of chairs.

1. Original number of normal chairs: 170
2. Original number of baby chairs: 23
3. Number of normal chairs sent for repair: 20
4. Number of baby chairs sent for repair: 13

First, calculate the number of normal chairs left:
\[ 170 \text{ normal chairs} - 20 \text{ normal chairs} = 150 \text{ normal chairs} \]

Next, calculate the number of baby chairs left:
\[ 23 \text{ baby chairs} - 13 \text{ baby chairs} = 10 \text{ baby chairs} \]

Finally, add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
\[ 150 \text{ normal chairs} + 10 \text{ baby chairs} = 160 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

answer:  First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute × 5 minutes = 1500 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute × 5 minutes = 1250 taps

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps

Now, let's add the taps for both feet:
- Right foot: 1500 taps + 400 taps = 1900 taps
- Left foot: 1250 taps + 400 taps = 1650 taps

Finally, let's add the total taps for both feet:
- Total taps = 1900 taps + 1650 taps = 3550 taps

Therefore, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is 3550.

answer:  To determine how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week.
2. Determine the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought last week.
3. Subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week:
- She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch.
- She bought 5 boxes of Fruit Loops.

So, the total number of boxes bought this week is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we know that last week she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

answer:  To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the total cost of fixing the pothole to the potential damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
- The fine for fixing the pothole is $120.
- The cost of the asphalt is 3 buckets × $25/bucket = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \]

Next, let's consider the potential damage to his car if the pothole doesn't get fixed:
- The damage to the car is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{255}

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 \text{ windows} = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, let's add the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows.

answer:  To find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat.

So, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:
\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the total time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
\[ \text{Total time} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of animals (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is \( 25 \) minutes.

answer:  Each pizza has 12 slices, so in total, there are 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2/3 of one pizza is:
\[ (2/3) * 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since Bryce and two friends ate 8 slices each, they ate a total of:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \text{ slices} \]

The two remaining friends each ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 3/4 of one pizza is:
\[ (3/4) * 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
Since the two remaining friends ate 9 slices each, they ate a total of:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices left is:
\[ 60 - 16 - 18 = 26 \text{ slices} \]

#### 26 slices.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem:

\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 9x = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

\[ \boxed{10} \]

answer:  To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

1. Calculate the number of smores for the kids:
   \[
   9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of smores for the adults:
   \[
   6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of smores needed:
   \[
   18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
   \]

4. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box, calculate the number of boxes needed:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ boxes}
   \]

answer:  To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]

4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:
   \[
   3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

Therefore, the number of those who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

answer:  First, we need to find the total number of spools of thread Candy has:

\[ \text{Total spools} = 15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} \]

\[ \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we count the number of blue spools:

\[ \text{Blue spools} = 15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of blue spools:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

answer:  Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many packs of gum he will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Each pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

Next, calculate the number of votes candidate B received:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, calculate the total number of votes for candidates A and B:
\[ \text{Total votes for A and B} = \text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Finally, calculate the number of votes candidate C received:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - \text{Total votes for A and B} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Candidate C received 50 votes.

answer:  To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to determine the ages of each person and then sum them up.

1. **Dora's age:**
   Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Dora's father's age:**
   Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Dora's mother's age:**
   Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
   \]

4. **Total combined age:**
   Add Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age.
   \[
   \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
   \]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \( 87 \) years.

answer:  To find the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying, we need to add up the weights of each book:

1. Math book: 2 pounds
2. Science book: 2 pounds
3. French book: 4 pounds
4. English book: 3 pounds
5. History book: Twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's add these weights together:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight is 17 pounds.

Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
The total cost for 10 gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.
The total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.
Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $50 + $48 = $98.

Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.
If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.
To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 100 - 87 = 13.
So, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris now.

answer:  To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many books Steven has.
2. Determine how many books Alice has.
3. Calculate the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 2S = 20 \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, Alice has:
\[ S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Finally, we calculate the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice. Clara has 20 books, so the difference is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]
Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

   - The plate initially had 2 slices.

2. **Slices added:**
   - Mara added 3 more slices.
   - Total slices after adding: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) slices.

3. **Tripling the slices:**
   - Mara tripled the number of slices.
   - Total slices after tripling: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) slices.

4. **Slices eaten:**
   - Mara ate 2 slices.
   - Total slices after eating: \( 15 - 2 = 13 \) slices.

5. **Slices stolen:**
   - Her friend stole 5 slices.
   - Total slices after theft: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

answer:  To determine the number of birds currently in the backyard, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of birds Jeremy scared away.
2. Subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds.
3. Add the number of birds that joined.

First, let's calculate the number of birds Jeremy scared away:
\[ \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds:
\[ \text{Number of birds remaining} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we add the number of birds that joined:
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

So, the total number of birds now in the backyard is 28.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

Given:
- Total number of students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = twice the number who like to play basketball, so \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)

The total number of students who like to either play video games or play music is the total number of students minus those who like to bake and those who like to play basketball:

\[ V + M = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

Substitute \( M = 10 \) into the equation:

\[ V + 10 = 35 \]

Solve for \( V \):

\[ V = 35 - 10 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of students in each class as \( x \).

Given that the total number of students in both classes is 80, we can write:
\[ 2x = 80 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

answer:  First, let's calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.50.
- Daily cost from the old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.50/tomato = $250.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.40.
- Daily cost from the new vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.40/tomato = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings:
- Daily savings = Daily cost from the old vendor - Daily cost from the new vendor
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly savings:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Weekly savings = Daily savings * Number of days in a week
- Weekly savings = $50 * 7 days = $350.

So, the vendor saves $350 a week.

answer:  Mark buys 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost for the packs is 3 * $1800 = $<<3*1800=5400>>5400.

He finds one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is $4000 + $1000 = $<<4000+1000=5000>>5000.

He also finds 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $<<30*50=1500>>1500.

The total value of all the cards is $5000 + $1500 = $<<5000+1500=6500>>6500.

The profit Mark made is $6500 - $5400 = $<<6500-5400=1100>>1100.

answer:  To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she needs to groom and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

First, let's add up the animals:
- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Next, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week (7 days):
28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:

- Cost for 2 adults: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
- Cost for 2 children: 2 children * $12/child = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:

- Cost for 2 adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
- Cost for 2 children: 2 children * $10/child = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:

- Total cost for the first amusement park: $76
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $48
- Difference in cost: $76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

The answer is $28.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther initially had 48 bananas.

2. **Bananas stolen by Arnold:**
   Arnold stole half of the bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, the number of bananas left is:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Bananas added by Gunther:**
   Gunther added 25 bananas to the pile.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Bananas stolen by Arnold again:**
   Arnold stole another 12 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Bananas added by Gunther again:**
   Gunther added another 6 bananas to the pile.
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Therefore, Gunther found \(\boxed{43}\) bananas in the pile.

answer:  To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of students and the number of students per group.

The total number of students is 54, and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size. Therefore, the number of students per group is:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. Since each group has 9 students, the total number of students needed for 12 groups is:
\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

Currently, we have 54 students. To find out how many more students are needed, we subtract the number of students we have from the total number of students required:
\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

Since each group contains 9 students, we can determine how many more groups are needed by dividing the number of additional students by the number of students per group:
\[ \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

answer:  To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Sean has.
2. Determine how many marbles Carl has.
3. Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean:
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:
\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a total of 336 marbles combined.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one week:
- Weekdays: 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week
- Weekends: 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week
- Total per week: 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs/week

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Total per month: 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs/month

Finally, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total per month: 2000 chairs
- Total for two months: 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.

answer:  To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played each day.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we add these numbers together:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \text{ matches} \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

answer:  To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.
2. Subtract the number of broken glasses and plates.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses.
- 1 dozen = 12 glasses
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses

- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates.
- 1 dozen = 12 plates
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we subtract the number of broken glasses and plates:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

So, the number of remaining glasses and plates is:
- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Therefore, Jeff now has:
- 86 glasses
- 42 plates

In total, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

answer:  To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly electricity bill.
2. Divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates to find the monthly cost per roommate.
3. Multiply the monthly cost per roommate by 12 to find the annual cost per roommate.

1. The total monthly electricity bill is $100.
2. Since Jenna has 4 roommates, we divide the total monthly bill by 4:
   \[
   \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
   \]
3. To find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
   \[
   \text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
   \]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

answer:  Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
- 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
- Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
- 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
- Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.
- Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27
- Large buttons: 60

Total buttons = 27 + 60 = 87 buttons

Therefore, Lorraine has 87 buttons by the end.

answer:  To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs in 20 playlists.
2. Calculate the total duration of all the songs in hours.

First, let's find the total number of songs in 20 playlists:
- Each playlist has 300 songs.
- John has 20 playlists.

So, the total number of songs is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all the songs:
- Each song is 10 hours long.
- There are 6000 songs.

So, the total duration in hours is:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60,000 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours.

answer:  To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students for each size category and then sum them up.

1. **Size extra-small**: 11 students
2. **Size small**: Twice as many as size extra-small
   \[
   2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ students}
   \]
3. **Size medium**: Four less than the number of size small students
   \[
   22 - 4 = 18 \text{ students}
   \]
4. **Size large**: Half as many as size medium
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ students}
   \]
5. **Size extra-large**: Six more than size large
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15 \text{ students}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of students for each size category:
\[
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts.

answer:  Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which is \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, we calculate:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

\( \boxed{22} \)

answer:  To find the price after the discount, you need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 7
   \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 133
   \]

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed by the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles, and the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs \( x \) cases of shingles, the third house also needs 100 cases of shingles.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 6 \times 4.5 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

answer:  First, calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, determine the number of people remaining after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Then, calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

answer:  To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has after receiving money from Ava.
2. Subtract the cost of the camera from the total amount of money Jayden has.

First, let's find out how much money Ava gave Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance:
\[ \text{Amount Ava gave} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, we add the amount Ava gave to Jayden's original amount of money:
\[ \text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the camera from the total amount of money Jayden has:
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

answer:  To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Determine the total cost of the oranges.

First, let's calculate the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice:
- To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
- Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs:
  \[
  4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg}
  \]

Next, let's determine the total cost of the oranges:
- Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
- Therefore, the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
  \[
  20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The answer is \( \boxed{60} \).

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits George has, we need to calculate the number of pears and then add it to the number of bananas.

1. **Calculate the number of pears:**
   - George has 200 bananas.
   - He has 45% more pears than bananas.
   - First, find 45% of 200:
     \[
     45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90
     \]
   - Add this to the number of bananas to get the number of pears:
     \[
     200 + 90 = 290
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - George has 200 bananas.
   - He has 290 pears.
   - Add the number of bananas and pears to get the total number of fruits:
     \[
     200 + 290 = 490
     \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.

answer:  To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we need to calculate the cost of each item they purchased and then sum these amounts.

1. **Leila's cucumbers:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - Each cucumber costs $2.
   - Total cost for cucumbers = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Jack's tomatoes:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes = \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Chase's lettuce:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce = \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of cucumbers + Cost of tomatoes + Cost of lettuce
- Total cost = $6 + $5 + $3 = $14

Therefore, the three of them spent a total of $14 on the ingredients for the potluck.

answer:  To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marissa had initially.
2. Subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount to find out how much money she has left.
3. Divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars she can buy.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

1. Marissa initially had $80.
2. She bought a ball for $20. So, we subtract $20 from $80:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball.
3. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, we divide $60 by $5:
   \[
   \frac{60}{5} = 12
   \]
   Marissa can buy 12 candy bars with the remaining $60.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

answer:  To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
2. Subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make.
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3 \text{ per eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, we subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Finally, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears of corn}} = \$3 \text{ per ear} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

answer:  To determine how much Tanya earned for the two days of teaching, we need to calculate her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she earns an additional $5 per day.
- Her hourly wage is $15.
- Total earnings for Monday = $15/hour * 5 hours + $5 = $75 + $5 = $80.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she does not earn the additional $5 per day.
- Her hourly wage is $15.
- Total earnings for Wednesday = $15/hour * 2 hours = $30.

**Total earnings for both days:**
- Earnings for Monday = $80
- Earnings for Wednesday = $30
- Total earnings for both days = $80 + $30 = $110

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

answer:  First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Ezra's books} = 2 \times \text{Ahmed's books} \]
\[ 300 = 2 \times \text{Ahmed's books} \]
\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of books Ezra read after reading 150 more books:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, let's find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's total books} + \text{Ahmed's books} \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, they have read a total of 600 books.

answer:  To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold.
2. Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- There are 4 vanilla scents available.
- Each vanilla scent is sold 5 times.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 4 vanilla scents * 5 sales per scent = 20.

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- There are 8 fruity scents available.
- Each fruity scent is sold 2 times.
- Total fruity scents sold = 8 fruity scents * 2 sales per scent = 16.

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold than fruity scents.

answer:  Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday + 5 hours on Sunday = 12 hours over the weekend.
She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours remaining.
She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours.
Therefore, she has 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours left for soccer.
To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

answer:  To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving and add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the total driving time:
- Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back home.
- The total distance is 150 miles + 150 miles = 300 miles.
- He drives at a speed of 75 mph.

The time taken to drive 300 miles at 75 mph is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time he spends at the museum:
- Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

The total time Jack is gone from home is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours (driving)} + 6 \text{ hours (at the museum)} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance they drove:

Speed of driving = 50 miles per hour
Time spent driving = 4 hours

Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles per hour × 4 hours = 200 miles

Next, let's calculate the speed of hiking:

Speed of hiking = 50 miles per hour / 2 - 5 miles per hour = 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the distance they hiked:

Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours

Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Finally, let's calculate the total distance to their vacation spot:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 200 miles + 30 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, the Llesis family's vacation spot was 230 miles away.

answer:  A third of the movies are in various series, so there are 600/3 = 200 series movies.
Each series movie costs $6, so the cost for the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.
The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so there are 400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.
Each older movie costs $5, so the cost for the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.
The rest of the movies are normal movies, so there are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies.
Each normal movie costs $10, so the cost for the normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.
The total cost of replacing the movies is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $<<1200+2400=4400>>4400.

answer:  To calculate the price you have to pay after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000, follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 200 \]

Next, subtract the discount amount from the original price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after a 20% discount.

answer:  To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum the costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches.
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Total cost for peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00

2. **Plums:**
   - Winston picked 8 pounds of plums.
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Total cost for plums: 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

3. **Apricots:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of apricots.
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Total cost for apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we sum the costs for all the fruits:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

answer:  Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( x \).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, making a total of 7 fish.

After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish in his pond is \( 7 + 17 = 24 \).

The number of orange fish after buying the new ones is \( 3 + x \), and the number of white fish after buying the new ones is \( 4 + x \).

According to the problem, after buying the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 3 + x = 8 + 2x \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

\[ 3 = 8 + x \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ -5 = x \]

\[ x = 5 \]

So, Bob bought 5 white fish.

answer:  To determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost $30.
2. Subtract the total cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the remaining two pizzas.
3. Divide the total cost of the remaining two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total cost of the two pizzas that each cost $30 is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract the total cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas:
   \[
   64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Divide the total cost of the remaining two pizzas by 2:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $2.

\boxed{2}

answer:  Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \), the number of berries Emma collects as \( B \), and the number of seconds Emma finishes the level as \( T \).

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies, collects \( B + 3 \) berries, and finishes the level in \( T - 4 \) seconds.

Emma's score is calculated as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T \]

Ava's score is calculated as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T) - (10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 95 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 95 points.

answer:  To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down their riding schedule and sum it up.

1. **First 5 days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - Total rides for these 5 days: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) rides.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - They ride twice the number of times they do on a usual day.
   - Since they ride 3 times on a usual day, they ride \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) times each day on these 2 days.
   - Total rides for these 2 days: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) rides.

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides for the first 5 days: 15 rides
   - Total rides for the next 2 days: 12 rides
   - Total rides in a week: \( 15 + 12 = 27 \) rides

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

1. **Number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

2. **Number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \)

3. **Number of OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the sales are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - 15
   - Number of OLED TVs = 25

Therefore, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

answer:  Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters. She spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, calculate the total value of the quarters:
\[ 140 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = \$35 \]

Next, calculate the total value of the twenties:
\[ 10 \text{ twenties} \times \$20 \text{ per twenty} = \$200 \]

Carrie spent all the quarters, so the amount spent on quarters is:
\[ \$35 \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, so the amount spent on twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times \$200 = \$120 \]

To find the total amount of money she paid for the lunch, add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties:
\[ \$35 + \$120 = \$155 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \$155 \]

answer:  To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work each week.
2. Determine the amount of gas used per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the gas used per week.

1. **Total distance Andy drives to work each week:**
   - One-way distance: 5 miles
   - Round trip distance: 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles
   - Total distance per week: 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

2. **Amount of gas used per week:**
   - Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG
   - Gas used per week: Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

3. **Cost of the gas used per week:**
   - Price of gas: $3/gallon
   - Total cost per week: Gas used per week * Price per gallon = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 worth of gas per week.

answer:  To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

 Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

answer:  To determine the number of people on the train after each stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   \[
   172
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 47 people get off the train:
     \[
     172 - 47 = 125
     \]
   - 13 people get on the train:
     \[
     125 + 13 = 138
     \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 38 people get off the train:
     \[
     138 - 38 = 100
     \]

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]

answer:  To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to calculate the temperature difference between the day and the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it is 33 degrees colder during the night. Therefore, the temperature at night is:
\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Carson's house needs to be at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. The temperature difference between 32 degrees and 12 degrees is:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to heat the house by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature difference by the temperature increase each log provides:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many 9-person groups were formed from the 90 people.

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members who brought back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members who brought back 2 seashells each.

\[ \text{Number of groups with 2 seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group has 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells.

\[ \text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since there are 6 such groups, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

Therefore, 108 seashells.

answer:  To determine how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike pays with.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The original price of the jeans is $40.
   - The discount is 25%.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10.

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
   - Sale price = Original price - Discount amount
   - Sale price = $40 - $10 = $30.

3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike pays with:
   - Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.
   - Amount left = Amount paid - Sale price
   - Amount left = $50 - $30 = $20.

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the discounted pair of jeans.

answer:  Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours of work each day. For any additional hours, she is paid at a rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, let's calculate her pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, let's calculate her pay for the additional hours:
\[ 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate, which is:
\[ 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, let's calculate her total pay for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

answer:  To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of the bottle caps in a 30-day month.

First, let's calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total number of bottle caps found in a 30-day month is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of these bottle caps:
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

So, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25 \text{ per bottle cap} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

answer:  To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost:
  \[
  3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2/\text{loaf} = \$6
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost:
  \[
  2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1/\text{bagel} = \$2
  \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of 3 loaves} - \text{Cost of 2 bagels} = \$6 - \$2 = \$4
\]

Thus, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

1. Calculate the time for "Deck the Halls":
   - The choir plans to sing "Deck the Halls" twice.
   - The length of "Deck the Halls" is 150 seconds.
   - Total time for "Deck the Halls" = 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.

2. Calculate the time for "Jingle Bells":
   - The choir plans to sing "Jingle Bells" once.
   - The length of "Jingle Bells" is 240 seconds.
   - Total time for "Jingle Bells" = 1 * 240 = 240 seconds.

3. Add the times for both songs:
   - Total caroling time = Time for "Deck the Halls" + Time for "Jingle Bells"
   - Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

1. Determine the initial number of employees.
2. Calculate the number of new employees hired each month.
3. Find the total number of employees after three months.
4. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees.

1. The initial number of employees is 200.
2. The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
   - First month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
   - Second month: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
   - Third month: 240 + 20 = 260 employees
4. Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees is:
   - 260 employees * $4000/employee = $104,000

So, the company will pay a total of $104,000 to its employees after three months.

answer:  Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial hourly wage, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, Billy's earnings will be $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230. Sally's earnings will be $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally.

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]
Since she plays for half an hour each day, she plays:
\[ 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so for one week, she plays:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these two amounts together, we get:
\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to earn the achievement by playing a total of 30 hours. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play for 9 hours to earn the achievement.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of students and teachers in the school.

Number of students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Total students = 25 students/class * 40 classes = 1000 students.

Number of teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Total teachers = 3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers.

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by students and teachers.

Trees planted by students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.

Trees planted by teachers:
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Total trees planted in the campaign = 1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1240 trees.

answer:  To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Pierson's points.
2. Calculate Nikita's points based on the given relationship.
3. Add Pierson's and Nikita's points together.

1. Pierson scored 278 points.
2. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. First, calculate half of Pierson's points:
   \[
   \text{Half of Pierson's points} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
   \]
   Then, add 11 to this amount to find Nikita's points:
   \[
   \text{Nikita's points} = 139 + 11 = 150
   \]
3. Now, add Pierson's and Nikita's points together to get the total points:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 278 + 150 = 428
   \]

Therefore, Pierson and Nikita scored a total of 428 points combined.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the stuffed goats will be \( 14 + x \).

The number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30(14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches he can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total number of square inches by the height of the mosaic:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold.
2. Calculate the amount of the premium.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold.
The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost of the diamond and gold is:
\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Step 2: Calculate the amount of the premium.
The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. Therefore, the premium is:
\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.
The total amount James paid is the cost of the diamond and gold plus the premium:
\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, James paid \boxed{1170}.

answer:  To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
- Speed of the first car = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles per hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
- Speed of the second car = 70 miles per hour
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles per hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Distance of the first car = 120 miles
- Distance of the second car = 140 miles
- Difference in distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

answer:  To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the pass rate for each grade and then find the average of those rates.

1. Third-graders:
   - 340 out of 500 passed.
   - Pass rate = 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

2. Fourth-graders:
   - 40 out of 100 passed.
   - Pass rate = 40/100 = 0.40 or 40%.

3. Fifth-graders:
   - The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Pass rate = 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 or 80%.

Now, we find the average of these pass rates:
- Average pass rate = (68% + 40% + 80%) / 3
- Average pass rate = 188% / 3
- Average pass rate = 62.67% (approximately)

So, the school's overall pass rate is 62.67%.

answer:  To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, let's find the total number of branches Felix climbed in the week:

 \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} \]
\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]
\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week (which is 7) to find the average:
\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} \]
\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} \]
\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

answer:  To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of butterscotch candies Dale had.
2. Subtract the number of candies he sold.
3. Add the number of candies he ordered later.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial number of butterscotch candies: 100
2. Candies sold: 150
3. Candies ordered later: 100

First, subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number:
\[ 100 - 150 = -50 \]

Since the result is a negative number, it means Dale has 50 butterscotch candies left after selling 150.

Next, add the number of candies ordered later:
\[ -50 + 100 = 50 \]

So, Dale still has 50 butterscotch candies left to sell after the additional order.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

There are 10 quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
\[ 48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of salt used as \( S \) ounces. According to the problem,

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so the fragrance is also \( S \) ounces.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so the sugar is also \( S \) ounces.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the oil is \( 2S \) ounces.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the zest is also \( S \) ounces.

The total volume of the jar is the sum of all the ingredients:
\[ S + S + S + S + 2S = 10 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 5S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

So, Tanya uses 2 ounces of salt. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2S = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, Tanya uses \boxed{4} ounces of oil.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean:
- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Next, let's account for the marshmallows dropped on the ground:
- They dropped 3 marshmallows.
- Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:
- The bag originally had 35 marshmallows.
- Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Finally, let's determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows:
- Each kid can have 14 marshmallows / 2 kids = 7 S'mores.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows left in the bag.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose initially picks:

1. 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Adding these together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, let's account for the flowers that are dropped:
- She drops 1 flower from each of the 4 groups, so she drops a total of 4 flowers.
- Each flower has 5 petals, so 4 flowers contribute 4 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 20 petals

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
101 petals - 20 petals = 81 petals

answer:  Jack can play for 1 quarter every 20 minutes. They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

First, calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 240 minutes:
240 minutes / 20 minutes per interval = 12 intervals

Since Jack uses 1 quarter per interval, he uses 12 quarters.

Next, let's calculate how long each of his friends can play:
- Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they each play for 20 minutes.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, calculate how many 30-minute intervals are in 240 minutes:
240 minutes / 30 minutes per interval = 8 intervals

Since this friend uses 1 quarter per interval, he uses 8 quarters.

Finally, add up all the quarters used:
12 quarters (Jack) + 8 quarters (friend) = 20 quarters

answer:  To determine how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money raised by the students.
2. Divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

First, let's find the total amount raised by the students:
- The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000.
- $50,000 came from organizations.

So, the amount raised by the students is:
\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we know there are 20 students. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:
\[ \text{Amount raised per student} = \frac{125,000}{20} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised **$6,250**.

answer:  To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has.
2. Subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:
- Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes.
- Paul has 40 toffee cupcakes.

So, the total number of cupcakes he has is:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Total cost of goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Total cost of cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost of goats = $1500
- Total cost of cows = $3000
- Total amount spent = $1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

answer:  Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:
\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

answer:  First, let's determine how many points Julie scored in the first game. Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha:

\[ \text{Julie's points in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Next, we know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie did in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game:

\[ \text{Sasha's points in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Now, we can find the total points Sasha scored in both games by adding her points from each game:

\[ \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's points in the first game} + \text{Sasha's points in the second game} \]
\[ \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.

answer:  To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Determine how many cars were left during the lunch break.
3. Calculate the number of cars he counted during the lunch break.

1. The total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]

2. When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. Therefore, the number of cars left during the lunch break is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]

3. The number of cars he counted during the lunch break is the total number of cars after the first break minus the number of cars left during the lunch break:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

answer:  To find the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the first day.
2. Calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the second day.
3. Add the times from both days to get the total.

First, calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the first day:
- Sandy walked for 8 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Next, calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the second day:
- Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day.
- Half of 8 hours is 4 hours.
- Therefore, 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, add the times from both days to get the total:
- 480 minutes (first day) + 240 minutes (second day) = 720 minutes.

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is \boxed{720} minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine how many tasks John completes in one day. John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.

\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much John earns in one day. Each task pays $1.20.

\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$180 \text{ per day} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds.
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
- Shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40.
- The return center is 20 miles away.
- The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
- Shipping cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.
- Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund Amazon will receive:
- The book cost $32.
- Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
- Refund = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
- Total loss = Total shipping cost - Refund
- Total loss = $3.00 - $24.00 = $21.00.

Therefore, Milly will lose $21.00.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 \]

Therefore, Becca has 141 cards.

answer:  To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
- Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins
- Difference = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

answer:  To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of egg and then sum them up.

1. **Green eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs.

\boxed{27}

answer:  The base installation cost is $129.00, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela needs:
- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

Total additional items = 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items

Each additional item costs $15.00, so the cost for the additional items is:
13 additional items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Base cost: $129.00
- Additional cost: $195.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $324.00.

answer:  To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

1. Mulan starts with $40.
2. Her father gives her $100.
   \[
   40 + 100 = 140
   \]
3. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.

answer:  Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week, which is:
\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup, which is:
\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these activities together, the total time spent on TikTok each week is:
\[ 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 \text{ minutes} \]

In a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok is:
\[ 282 \times 4 = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ 1128 \div 60 = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Britany spends 18 hours on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine the speed of one kangaroo. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, the speed of one kangaroo is:

\[ \text{Speed of one kangaroo} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ kangaroos}} = 6 \text{ hours per kangaroo} \]

Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is:

\[ \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{6 \text{ hours per kangaroo}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours per turtle} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to travel the same distance. Since one turtle takes 3 hours to travel the distance, four turtles will take:

\[ \text{Total time for four turtles} = 4 \text{ turtles} \times 3 \text{ hours per turtle} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 12 hours to travel across the highway.

answer:  To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of lifting abilities from Pompei to Naruto.

1. **Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.**
2. **Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.
3. **Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.
4. **Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami.**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet:
- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- Therefore, 480 inches is equal to \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain that is 40 feet high.

answer:  To determine how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Calculate how much money Roy has saved based on Anthony's savings.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's savings:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved **$42.00**.

3. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance in the first segment + Distance in the second segment
   - Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

answer:  To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows.
2. Determine how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters.
3. Calculate how many additional cows are required to produce the remaining milk.

First, let's calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters per cow} = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we determine how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters:
\[ 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we calculate how many additional cows are required to produce the remaining 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters per cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Erika already has in her purse as \( S \).

The original cost of the laptop is $600, and after trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika has already received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she has received is:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

She still needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she currently has is:
\[ S + 230 - 50 = 400 \]

Now, we can solve for \( S \):
\[ S + 230 - 50 = 400 \]
\[ S + 180 = 400 \]
\[ S = 400 - 180 = 220 \]

Therefore, Erika already has $220 in her purse.

answer:  To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to calculate the number of dishes each person makes based on the given information.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   - Kora makes 20 dishes.

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   - Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   - Therefore, Rory makes \( 20 + 20 = 40 \) dishes.

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   - Therefore, Jada makes \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) dishes.

Now, we sum up the number of dishes made by all three:
- Kora's dishes: 20
- Rory's dishes: 40
- Jada's dishes: 80

Total number of dishes = \( 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \)

Therefore, Jada, Rory, and Kora make a total of 140 clay dishes together.

\( \boxed{140} \)

answer:  To determine how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large apples.
2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small apples.
3. Add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices.
4. Subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- Total slices from large apples = 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- Total slices from small apples = 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, add the slices from the large and small apples:
- Total slices = 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

answer:  Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 * $2 = $12 on squirt guns.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 * $3 = $9 on water balloons.

In total, he spends $12 + $9 = $21.

Therefore, Craig has $40 - $21 = $19 left.

answer:  To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.
2. Determine how much money Gabriel currently has.
3. Subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.
The cost of the car is $10000 and the cost of the phone is $800.
Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Step 2: Determine how much money Gabriel currently has.
Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200.
Money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Step 3: Subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost.
Money still needed = Total cost - Money Gabriel has
Money still needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

answer:  To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \( 16 \) millimeters.

answer:  To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. The total number of students in the class is 20.
2. The number of students who are good at math only is 5.
3. The number of students who perform well in English only is 8.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:

\[ 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 \]

Now, the total number of students who are good at math is the sum of the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, there are 12 students good at math.

\[ \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, let's determine the number of socks Peter has. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has:

\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's determine the number of dishes Peter has. Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has:

\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Finally, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ \boxed{180} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time available for each group, excluding the intermission:

- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time for the show, including the intermission:

- Total show time: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Total available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, let's determine how many groups can perform in the available time:

- Total available time for groups: 110 minutes
- Total time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = Total available time for groups / Total time per group
Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group
Number of groups = 11

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

answer:  To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes.

First, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:
- James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the total number of pairs of shoes in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs} \]

Next, we divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes:
- James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
- He buys 24 pairs of shoes.

So, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \frac{2640}{24} = 110 \]

Therefore, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes.

answer:  First, determine how many trays are needed to hold 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling the trays at $2.5 per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

\[ \text{Number of white shirts with collars} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Next, find the number of white shirts without collars:
\[ \text{Number of white shirts without collars} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Then, determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:
\[ \text{Number of floral shirts with buttons} = 20 \]

Now, find the number of floral shirts without buttons:
\[ \text{Number of floral shirts without buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Finally, calculate how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of floral shirts without buttons} - \text{Number of white shirts without collars} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

\[ \boxed{10} \]

answer:  First, determine the number of goats sold from each farm:
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, calculate the number of goats left on each farm after the sale:
- Farm X: 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats

Finally, add the number of goats left on both farms to find the total:
- 45 goats (Farm X) + 25 goats (Farm Y) = 70 goats

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

answer:  Let's denote your brother's age as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- You are three years younger than your brother, so your age is \( B - 3 \).
- You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87:
\[ B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

So, your brother is 16 years old. Your age is \( B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \).

You are 13 years old.

answer:  To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

First, find the number of rooms to be cleaned:
\[ \text{Number of rooms to be cleaned} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, calculate the total time required to clean these rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$25 \text{ per basket} = \$75 \]

Next, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food before the discount:
\[ 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$18 \text{ per basket} = \$54 \]

Now, apply the discount to each basket of red food:
\[ \$18 \text{ per basket} - \$2 \text{ per basket} = \$16 \text{ per basket} \]

Calculate the total cost for the discounted red food:
\[ 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$16 \text{ per basket} = \$48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to find the total cost:
\[ \$75 + \$48 = \$123 \]

So, you will have to pay a total of \$123 for 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the $2 discount on each basket of red food.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, let's calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply $800 by 0.10:

\[ 800 \times 0.10 = 80 \]

Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so she received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, let's find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1520 in tips altogether.

answer:  To determine the total number of homes the town will build over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   - The town builds 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town builds three times as many homes as in the first year.
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The town counts the total number of homes built in the first two years and doubles this amount.
   - The total number of homes built in the first two years is \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the town will have built a total of 144 homes over the next three years.

Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30 \]

We know the number of gold coins is 70:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 110 coins in total.

answer:  Claire earns 1 badge every month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so it takes her 2 * 1 = 2 months to earn a badge.

In a year, Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 1 = 3 badges per month.

In a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

36 - 6 = 30

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

answer:  Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so she gave away 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 oranges.
She also gave her only boy 3 oranges, so she gave away a total of 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 oranges.
Therefore, Jennifer remained with 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 oranges.

answer:  First, let's determine how many loaves Paige can bake in 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she can bake:

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total revenue is:

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paige raised $40.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of the bag of potatoes.
2. Calculate the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes.
3. Calculate the weight of the bag of carrots based on the weight of the sweet potatoes.

1. The weight of the bag of potatoes is given as 5 pounds.
2. The weight of the bag of sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the bag of potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The weight of the bag of carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:
   \[
   10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The rink has a total of 75 cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

answer:  To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos given to the students and Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract this total from the original number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

According to the problem:
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Next, calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, calculate the number of pieces he ate on the second day:
\[ 10 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the number of pieces remaining after the second day:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Add up all the pieces he has eaten so far:
\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of the pizza so far.

Now, calculate how much Keenan pays:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly contribution} = \text{Total weekly cost} - \text{Madeline's weekly contribution} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

answer:  To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of marbles Paul has.
2. Add the number of marbles his friend gave him.
3. Subtract the number of marbles he lost.

Let's go through each step:

1. Paul initially has 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles. So, we add 28 to 52:
   \[
   52 + 28 = 80
   \]
   Now, Paul has 80 marbles.
3. Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
   \]
   So, Paul lost 20 marbles. We subtract these 20 marbles from his 80:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

2. Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts:

Each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:

David has $12.48.
\[ \text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

answer:  First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is \( \frac{21}{7} = $3.00 \).

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water:
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is \( \frac{8}{4} = $2.00 \).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
- The cost of 3 bottles of soda is \( 3 \times 3.00 = $9.00 \).
- The cost of 2 bottles of water is \( 2 \times 2.00 = $4.00 \).

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = $13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

answer:  To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find her hourly wage. Ella earned $33 for 3 hours, so we can calculate her hourly wage:

\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Total hours}} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works to find her total earnings for 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Total hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

answer:  To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Haircut**: Iris spent $400 to do her hair.
2. **Manicure**: She spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much as the haircut.
   \[
   \text{Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. **Pedicure**: She spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as the manicure.
   \[
   \text{Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Haircut} + \text{Manicure} + \text{Pedicure}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Therefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

answer:  Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens} \]

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars} \]

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias's total revenue from selling the chickens must be:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens for $7000, the cost per chicken is:
\[ \frac{7000}{180} = 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken} \]

Therefore, Isaias bought each chicken he took to the market for sale for $38.89.

answer:  To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell.
2. Determine how many glasses Micah sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

1. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell is:
   \[
   32 - 14 = 18
   \]

2. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   So, Micah sold 9 glasses.

3. Now, we find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah:
   \[
   14 - 9 = 5
   \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

answer:  To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to account for the additional 15-minute encore and the fact that her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

Given:
- The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
- There is an additional 15-minute encore.
- The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total runtime of the final concert:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To solve for \( x \), we follow these steps:
1. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 - 15 = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

answer:  Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now.

In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + y \). At that time, her age will be thrice her present age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

\( \boxed{16} \) years.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Sarah will make from selling her current rope. The rope is 20 meters long and her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Profit from selling the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2 \text{ per meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope is 20 meters long and costs $1.5 per meter.

\[ \text{Cost of the new rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5 \text{ per meter} = \$30 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \text{Profit from selling the rope} - \text{Cost of the new rope} \]
\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.

\[ \boxed{10} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of each type of item:

1. Bacon: 5 packs cost $10, so each pack costs $10/5 = $2.
2. Chicken: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs 2 * $2 = $4.
3. Strawberries: Each pack costs $4, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.
4. Apples: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4/2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:

- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: 6 * $4 = $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: 7 * $2 = $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount of money left is:

$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes a total of 500 chimichangas on those three days.

answer:  To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't find space.
2. Subtract the number of microphones that won't find space from the total number of microphones to find the number that will fit in pairs.
3. Divide the number of microphones that will fit in pairs by 2 to find the number of pairs.

First, calculate the number of microphones that won't find space:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, subtract the number of microphones that won't find space from the total number of microphones:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 microphones will fit in pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that will fit in pairs by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

answer:  First, we need to determine the speed of a thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that this speed is eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by eleven:

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of a whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \, \text{meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by five:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \, \text{meters per second} \]

Thus, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

answer:  To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals from orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals from daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of petals on the daisies and the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Difference = Total petals from daisies - Total petals from orchids
- Difference = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many cookies Lani has left after eating 5 cookies. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

So, Lani has 50 cookies left.

Next, we need to divide these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of jars:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, each jar contains 10 cookies.

answer:  First, determine the number of indoor plants:
\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Then, determine the number of outdoor plants:
\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Finally, calculate the number of flowering plants:
\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering.

   Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.

2. **Carl's weight:**
   Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.
   \[
   \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} = 71 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Christian's weight:**
   Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \text{ kg} + 8 \text{ kg} = 79 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Harry's weight:**
   Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} = 74 \text{ kg}
   \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is \( 74 \) kg.

\[ \text{New wage} = \text{Old wage} + \text{Raise} \]
\[ \text{New wage} = \$10 + \$2 = \$12 \]

Next, calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:
\[ \text{Hours per week} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week} \]
\[ \text{Hours per week} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Hours per week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, calculate Mark's weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{New wage} \times \text{Hours per week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$12/\text{our} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$480 \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:

\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:

\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost of the carrots is:

\[ \text{Cost of carrots} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:

\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\text{Cost of carrots}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Thus, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

1. She mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.
2. She mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
3. She mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is:
\[ x + 3x + 5x = 9x \]

Since Joe paid her $6 per lawn, the total earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 9x \times 6 = 54x \]

We know Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[ 80 - 54x \]

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we need to know the value of \( x \). However, since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can only express her earnings from lemonade sales in terms of \( x \):
\[ 80 - 54x \]

Tasha made 80 - 54x dollars from lemonade sales.

answer:  First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha initially had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially had.

\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Let \( J \) represent the number of notebooks Joseph had.

\[ J = 3M \]
\[ J = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 6 \]

So, Joseph initially had 6 notebooks.

Now, after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has:

\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha now has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

answer:  First, calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total income from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Finally, subtract the car payment from the total income to find the profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

John makes a profit of $250 on his car.

answer:  First, let's determine the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's determine the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Finally, let's add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Material needed for small masks: 10 yards
- Material needed for large masks: 6 yards
- Total material needed: \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) yards

Jo needs 16 yards of material.

answer:  To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to determine the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles.

First, calculate the additional distance Anis rowed:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, add this additional distance to the distance Dijana rowed to find the total distance Anis rowed:
\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, add the distances Dijana and Anis rowed to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of soup needed for the adults and children.

Adults: 2 (Calvin) + 1 (wife) = 3 adults
Children: 2 children

Total bowls needed for the adults and children = 3 adults + 2 children = 5 bowls

Calvin's pot has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since he has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.

Now, let's calculate the amount of leftover soup:

Total bowls needed for adults and children = 5 bowls
Total bowls available = 8 bowls

Leftover bowls = 8 bowls - 5 bowls = 3 bowls

Since each child can have one bowl of soup, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup from the leftover soup.

Leftover bowls = 3 bowls
Number of children = 2 children

Each child can have 3 bowls / 2 children = 1.5 bowls.

answer:  To determine how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Denise read:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages today.

Therefore, the total number of pages Denise read is:
\[ 10 + 18 = 28 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Daniel read:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel read 0 pages (since he did not read any pages today).

Therefore, the total number of pages Daniel read is:
\[ 13 + 0 = 13 \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of pages Denise read and the total number of pages Daniel read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

answer:  William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each, so the cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

He also bought one ballpen at $0.50, so the cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

answer:  To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total 24 hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) hours a night.
3. Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Sleeping: 10 hours
- Working: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time spent on these activities from the total 24 hours in a day to find the free time:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

\[
\boxed{5}

answer:  To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Calculate the total amount of money she spent.
3. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's find the total number of tickets Deepa has seen:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.

So, the total number of tickets is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know Deepa spent $216 in total.

Now, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket:
\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed 8 \]

answer:  First, determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses to go fishing:
- Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Next, determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses to go fishing:
- Tim uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes.
- He has 9 red shoe boxes initially.
- \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\) red shoe boxes.

Now, calculate the number of blue shoe boxes left:
- Tim initially has 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is \(7 - 3 = 4\).

Finally, calculate the number of red shoe boxes left:
- Tim initially has 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 red shoe boxes.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box.

In total, Tim has \(4 + 6 = 10\) shoe boxes left in his box.

answer:  Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

Duncan's age eight years ago was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

answer:  To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of marbles Dean gives to Jamie.
2. Subtract the number of marbles given to Jamie from the original number of marbles.
3. Subtract the number of marbles given to Donald from the remaining marbles.

First, let's calculate the number of marbles Dean gives to Jamie:
\[ \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, we subtract the number of marbles given to Jamie from the original number of marbles:
\[ \text{Marbles left after giving to Jamie} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of marbles given to Donald from the remaining marbles:
\[ \text{Marbles left after giving to Donald} = 24 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

answer:  Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.
Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres.
So, Farmer Smith's farm is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

The total size of the two farms together is 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

answer:  To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the hours worked on each day:
\[
5 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ hours (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

\[ 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, and 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find the number of yellow balloons, divide the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon:

\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]

answer:  First, determine the time it takes for John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. Since a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, an extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 3 hours, we need to determine how many half-hour intervals are in 3 hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ half-hours per hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since he drinks one bottle every half hour, the number of bottles he drinks is:

\[ 6 \text{ half-hours} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

Then, calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5 \text{ per lollipop} = \$150 \]

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \$90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, so for 12 balloons, the cost is (12 / 2) * $0.5 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they spent is $28.

To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount spent by the number of girls:
$28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cups Lana has in each row. Since she has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows, each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's denote the number of cups of mint tea in each row as \( x \). Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row is also \( x \). Therefore, the total number of cups in each row is:

\[ x + x = 2x \]

We know that each row has 9 cups in total, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 9 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea. Since the question asks for the number of cups of mint tea in each row, the answer is:

\[ 4.5 \text{ cups} \]

answer:  To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed per day by both Abby and Josh.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Therefore, the total number of slices consumed per day is \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices consumed per day:

\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dogs}
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ rabbits}
   \]
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ fish}
   \]
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has 1/3 the number of fish he has.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7 \text{ gerbils}

Now, we sum up all the pets:
\[

answer:  To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of years she has been collecting shells.

Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old and will turn 10 years old on her 10th birthday. Therefore, she has been collecting shells for:
\[ 10 \text{ years} - 5 \text{ years} = 5 \text{ years} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells by multiplying the number of years by the number of months per year:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The answer is:
\[ 60 \]

answer:  First, let's determine the calories in one mini cinnamon roll and one mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.

Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories from all pastries:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

answer:  First, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, so:

\[ \text{Initial water in the tank} = \frac{10000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so:

\[ \text{Total water used} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

answer:  To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate the total number of trips he needs to make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we divide the total time by the time it takes for one trip:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we know the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total. To find out how many berries he needs to pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries.

answer:  Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost 5 * $10 = $50.
He has also seen 8 movies on other days, which cost 8 * $7 = $56.
He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost 2 * $8 = $16.
He has had 4 boxes of candy, which cost 4 * $2 = $8.
So far, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.
Colby's parents gave him $150 to spend at the movies, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.
He wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.
So, he has $20 - $10 = $10 left for movie tickets.
Each movie ticket on Friday or Saturday costs $10, so he can buy $10 / $10 = 1 movie ticket.
Therefore, he can see 1 more movie on the last day of the month.

answer:  Let's denote the age of Jean as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old.

Now, we can find Peter's age:
\[ \text{Peter's age} = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 50 + 10 = 50 \]

answer:  To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles
- Distance traveled by the car: 240 miles
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

answer:  To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removes over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum up the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is \boxed{60}.

answer:  The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.
Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * $6 = $259200.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 * $6 = $194400.
Therefore, the Widgeteer 3000 makes $259200 - $194400 = $64800 more than the WidgetMaster 9000

answer:  To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls.
2. Subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls:

- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

So, Sophie had 48 toys before buying the bouncy balls.

Next, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[
\boxed{14}

Next, we add the 10 boxes they already have:

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so we need to find out how many tables are required:
\[ 60 \text{ boxes} \div 2 \text{ boxes/table} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

answer:  First, calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out:
\[ 20 \text{ words} \times 15 \text{ letters/word} = 300 \text{ letters} \]

Next, determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 350 \text{ letters} \]

Now, add the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother:
\[ 300 \text{ letters} + 350 \text{ letters} = 650 \text{ letters} \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650 letters.

answer:  First, calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance for both Zoey and Sydney and then find the average of those distances.

First, let's calculate the total distance for Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.
- Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Next, let's calculate the total distance for Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.
- Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's find the total distance for both Zoey and Sydney:
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Finally, we find the average distance:
- Average distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average distance = 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.

So, the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney is 410 feet.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of a 24-hour stay:
- 12-hour cost: 1000 pesos
- Additional 12 hours: 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos
- Total cost for 24-hour stay: 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos

Next, calculate the cost of a 19-hour stay:
- 12-hour cost: 1000 pesos
- Additional 7 hours: 7 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 490 pesos
- Total cost for 19-hour stay: 1000 pesos + 490 pesos = 1490 pesos

Now, find the difference in cost between a 24-hour stay and a 19-hour stay:
- Difference: 1840 pesos - 1490 pesos = 350 pesos

Cameron would save 350 pesos by opting for a 19-hour stay instead of a 24-hour stay.

answer:  First, calculate John's total earnings for the week:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = <<50*6=300>>300 dollars

Next, subtract the amount he spends on gas from his total earnings:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = <<300-50=250>>250 dollars

Then, subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = <<250-100=150>>150 dollars

Now, calculate the cost of the 5 pencils:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = <<5*10=50>>50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = <<150-50=100>>100 dollars

Finally, determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = <<100/25=4>>4 pens

So John can buy 4 pens.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs after the discount.

Each CD costs $15, and James gets a 40% discount.
\[ \text{Discount per CD} = 15 \times 0.40 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Sale price per CD} = 15 - 6 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 CDs} = 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

Next, James sells 5 of these CDs for $40 each.
\[ \text{Total revenue from selling 5 CDs} = 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's calculate the net amount of money James was out.
\[ \text{Net loss} = \text{Total cost for 10 CDs} - \text{Total revenue from selling 5 CDs} \]
\[ \text{Net loss} = 90 - 200 = -110 \]

Therefore, James was out $110.

\[ \boxed{-110} \]

answer:  To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons.
2. Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemable.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles the teacher can redeem:
- The teacher has 9 coupons.
- Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles.
- Total bottles redeemable = 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bottles given to the students:
- There are 29 pupils in the class.
- Each pupil receives 2 bottles.
- Total bottles given = 29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles.

Now, subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemable:
- Bottles remaining = 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles.

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

answer:  To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children per school and then multiply by the number of schools.

1. Calculate the number of children per school:
   - There are 8 children in each row.
   - There are 7 rows per school.
   - Therefore, the number of children per school is:
     \[
     8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school}
     \]

2. Calculate the total number of children in all schools:
   - There are 5 schools.
   - Therefore, the total number of children in all schools is:
     \[
     56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children}
     \]

So, there can be 280 children in the drill.

answer:  To determine the total charge for the job, we need to calculate the labor cost, the cost of parts, and the visit fee.

1. **Labor Cost:**
   - Patty charges $35 per hour for labor.
   - The job took 2.25 hours.
   - Labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours = $75.

2. **Cost of Parts:**
   - The cost of parts is $60.

3. **Visit Fee:**
   - The visit fee is $40.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total charge:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Cost of Parts} + \text{Visit Fee} \]

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \$75 + \$60 + \$40 \]

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \$175 \]

Therefore, Patty charged $175 for the job.

answer:  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim the first part of the lake.
After swimming the first part, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
The remaining distance to swim is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.
He then swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
It takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance.
The total time James takes to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

answer:  To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Number of yams: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = \$9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = \$20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = \$5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ \$9 \text{ (yams)} + \$20 \text{ (sweet potatoes)} + \$5 \text{ (carrots)} = \$34 \]

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

answer:  To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result of step 2 to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given:
- Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
- The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]
3. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So, we subtract 40 from 490:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

answer:  To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch.
- Each paper is printed on both sides.

First, calculate the total number of pages in the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness of the book} \times \text{Pages per inch} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the total number of pages is twice the number of pages:
\[ \text{Total pages} = 2 \times 150 \text{ pages} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 300 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 300 pages.

answer:  To find Leo's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Marcus's age.
2. Use the information that Marcus is half of Leo's age to find Leo's age.

First, let's find Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]
\[ 11 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, we multiply 11 by 2:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 11 \times 2 = 22 \]

So, Leo is 22 years old.

answer:  First, calculate the commission from each type of newspaper:

- For the New York Times:
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Price per copy: $5
  - Number of copies sold: 6
  - Commission per copy: $5 * 0.10 = $0.50
  - Total commission from New York Times: $0.50/copy * 6 copies = $3

- For the Wall Street Journal:
  - Commission rate: 8%
  - Price per copy: $15
  - Number of copies sold: 10
  - Commission per copy: $15 * 0.08 = $1.20
  - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: $1.20/copy * 10 copies = $12

Now, add the commissions from both types of newspapers to find the total commission:

- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

So, Cayley will earn a total of $15 in commission.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of occupied beds initially. Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied:

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of unoccupied beds initially:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted each day:

\[ \text{Patients admitted per day} = 50 \]

Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Finally, let's calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \boxed{100}.

answer:  Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by the team is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

answer:  Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. 

One day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 2 hours and 23 minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes + 23 minutes = 143 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking from the total time she slept.

Total time slept = 8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes

Time spent sleepwalking = 143 minutes

Sleeping time on bed = Total time slept - Time spent sleepwalking
Sleeping time on bed = 480 minutes - 143 minutes = 337 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 337 minutes that day.

answer:  To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to determine the total time he stapled and then multiply that by his rate of stapling reports.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince stapled:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 5 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours is 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 300 minutes:
- 300 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 20 intervals.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 20 intervals, he can staple:
- 20 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 600 reports.

So, Vince stapled 600 reports altogether.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, he has:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils (measuring cups and measuring spoons) Jonathan has remaining. He has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils is:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Now, we can find the number of balls carried by Jason and Jordan:
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each:
\[ \text{Total balls} = \text{Jeffrey's balls} + \text{Jason's balls} + \text{ordan's balls} = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \( 7 \).

3. One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. The remaining emails after sending to her family are \(9 - 6 = 3\). Therefore, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]

So, Robyn sends **1 email a day** to her boyfriend.

answer:  Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

So, Stan has caught \( 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \) Pokemon.

answer:  To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to adjust Courtney's reported number by reducing by 20%.

First, calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Next, subtract this amount from Courtney's reported number:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.

answer:  To determine the total number of corn chips, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of corn chips each person received.
2. Calculate the total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey.
3. Determine the number of corn chips Collins received.
4. Add the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins to find the total.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. The total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey is:
   \[
   70 + 70 = 140
   \]
3. Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey, so Collins received:
   \[
   70 + 15 = 85
   \]
4. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
   \[
   140 + 85 = 225
   \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips altogether is 225.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug during the first three days:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes in the first three days = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

Next, we need to account for the holes filled in on the third day:
- Holes filled in on the third day: 2 holes

Total holes after the third day = 31 - 2 = 29 holes

On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10 holes

Total holes on the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total holes after the third day from the total holes on the fourth day:
Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 29 = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

answer:  First, we need to determine Nani's brother's age. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find Nani's sister's age. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find this, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:

\[ \text{25% of Nani's age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of all three of the family members is 30 years.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets based on the percentage increase.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to find the total cost.

1. The cost of the supplies is $400.
2. The cost of the travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies. To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.50:
   \[
   400 \times 0.50 = 200
   \]
   So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
   \[
   400 + 200 = 600
   \]
3. The total cost of the travel is the sum of the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets:
   \[
   400 + 600 = 1000
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $1000.

answer:  To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First segment:**
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second segment:**
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third segment:**
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments:
- Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of episodes in the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Minutes per episode}}{2} \]

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes in the show.

Next, we calculate the total time John will spend watching the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Minutes per episode} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

answer:  To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = \text{perimeter} \times \text{slats per foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ slats/foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had:

1. She made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies.
3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

So, Greta had a total of 66 brownies.

Next, let's determine how many brownies were eaten during the party:

1. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is:
\[ 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \]

So, 18 brownies were eaten.

Finally, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies to find out how many are left over:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

answer:  John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which is a total of 4 phones.
The first 2 phones are at the full price of $600 each, so the cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.
The remaining 2 phones are half price, so each phone is $600 / 2 = $300.
The cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.
Therefore, the total cost for all 4 phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

answer:  To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of players in Carlton's team.
2. Determine the number of players in Zeke's team based on the given information.
3. Add the number of players in both teams to get the total.

Given:
- Carlton's team has 13 players.
- Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team.

First, calculate the number of players in Zeke's team:
\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players in Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, add the number of players in both teams:
\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players in Carlton's team} + \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as \( R \) and the number of cherries Jerry has as \( J \).

Given:
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
- The total number of cherries is 60.

From the information given:
- \( R + 10 = 30 \)
- \( R = 30 - 10 \)
- \( R = 20 \)

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60:
- \( R + R + J = 60 \)
- \( 20 + 30 + J = 60 \)
- \( 50 + J = 60 \)
- \( J = 60 - 50 \)
- \( J = 10 \)

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
- \( R - J = 30 - 10 = 20 \)

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

answer:  To find the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of states in the USA.
2. Calculate the number of states in India based on the given relationship.
3. Add the number of states in both countries to get the total.

Step 1: Identify the number of states in the USA
The USA has 50 states.

Step 2: Calculate the number of states in India
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. First, half the number of states in the USA is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
Adding 4 to this number gives:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]
So, India has 29 states.

Step 3: Add the number of states in both countries
The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\).

answer:  Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges initially. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so 4 boxes contain 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

After giving away 4 boxes, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so 8 boxes contain 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

Therefore, she sold 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

answer:  First, let's determine how old Emil will be when he turns 24. Since he is currently 19 years old, he will be:

\[ 19 + 5 = 24 \]

When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, his dad's age will be:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

So, his dad's current age is:

\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \]

When Emil turns 24, he will also be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, his brother's age will be:

\[ 24 \div 2 = 12 \]

So, his brother's current age is:

\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Now, let's find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now:

\[ 43 + 7 = 50 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

\[ 50 \]

answer:  To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the books.
2. Subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from the total cost.
3. Divide the remaining amount by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the books:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from the total cost:
- Amount saved: $14

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount saved
Remaining amount = $39 - $14 = $25

Finally, we divide the remaining amount by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:
- Hourly wage: $5

Hours to work = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, determine how many ounces of sunscreen she will need:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle to find out how many bottles she needs:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \div 8 \text{ ounces/bottle} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boxes sold on each day.

**On Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer than on Sunday, so 15 - 4 = 11 boxes

**On Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more than on Saturday, so 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, let's calculate the earnings for each day.

**On Saturday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
- Apple pie earnings: 11 boxes * $15/box = $165
- Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

**On Sunday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
- Apple pie earnings: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225
- Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total earnings for both days:**
- Total: $540

answer:  To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Charlie's shoe size.
2. Calculate the sum of their shoe sizes.
3. Divide the sum by 2 to find the average.

First, let's find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie has boots that are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's shoe size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the sum of their shoe sizes:

\[ \text{Sum of shoe sizes} = \text{Sophie's shoe size} + \text{Charlie's shoe size} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the sum by 2 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average shoe size} = \frac{\text{Sum of shoe sizes}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15.

answer:  To find the total cost of both cars, we first need to determine the price of the red car. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means it costs 60% of the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = 60\% \text{ of } \$100 \]

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = 0.60 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Price of the blue car} + \text{Price of the red car} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pounds.

Now, add up the total amount of crawfish caught:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} + 12 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, given that each serving is 3 pounds.

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total pounds of crawfish}}{\text{Pounds per serving}} \]
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

1. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add these amounts together:

20 + 30 + 40 = 90

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

answer:  To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.
2. Calculate the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

First, we know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) as many as Edgar. Therefore, we calculate the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day as follows:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

\[
\boxed{63}
\]

answer:  First, calculate the number of football players:
\[ \text{Number of football players} = 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, calculate the number of students who are not football players:
\[ \text{Number of students who are not football players} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Now, calculate the number of cheerleaders or part of the band:
\[ \text{Number of cheerleaders or part of the band} = 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Finally, add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and part of the band to find the total number of students leaving early:
\[ \text{Total number of students leaving early} = \text{Number of football players} + \text{Number of cheerleaders or part of the band} = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]

answer:  First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Since each plant is 12 inches wide, the total space required for the plants is:
\[ 1332 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/plant} = 111 \text{ plants} \]

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs is:
\[ 111 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 94 \text{ plants} \]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 94 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 564 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $564 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

answer:  To determine the total cost for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by 5.

1. **Cost for one basket:**
   - Petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
   - Sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00
   - Total cost for one basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

2. **Total cost for 5 baskets:**
   - Total cost for 5 baskets: $14.00 per basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

answer:  To determine Bill's age when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years since Bill's dad saw the comet.
2. Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time.
3. Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

First, we know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

Next, Bill saw the comet the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill saw the comet the second time 75 years after he saw it the first time, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet Halley for the first time.

answer:  First, let's determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's determine how long it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can cook in 10 minutes:

\[ \text{Time to cook} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time to peel and the time to cook to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

answer:  First, determine how much money Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. She saves 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly salary:

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00:

\[ \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner:

1. **Low mode (3 hours):**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Duration: 3 hours
   - Cooling effect: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

2. **High mode (4 hours):**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Duration: 4 hours
   - Cooling effect: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

Total cooling effect: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Next, let's calculate the warming effect of the room when the air conditioner is off:

1. **Room warming rate:** 2 degrees per hour
   - Duration: 2 hours
   - Warming effect: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Net cooling effect: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Since the net cooling effect is 14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \).

Given that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout the day. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 44 = \frac{1}{2}F \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 \]
\[ F = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in one day.

The number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

answer:  To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of all three howls:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total duration from seconds to minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of slices each kid gets. Since there are 4 kids and each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, we can assume each kid gets 1 slice. Therefore, each adult gets 2 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices each adult gets. Since there are 2 adults and each adult gets 2 slices, the total number of slices for the adults is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices in the family. Since there are 4 kids and each kid gets 1 slice, the total number of slices for the kids is:
\[ 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices in the family is:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets:
\[ \frac{4}{8} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

answer:  To determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and online fund.
2. Add the amount given by Walter's friend to the total.
3. Multiply the total amount collected by 3 to find out how much Walter's lawyer will donate.

First, let's calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and online fund:
\[ 500 \text{ (neighbors)} + 1500 \text{ (online fund)} = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, add the amount given by Walter's friend:
\[ 2000 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ (friend)} = 2200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, multiply the total amount collected by 3 to find out how much Walter's lawyer will donate:
\[ 2200 \text{ dollars} \times 3 = 6600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \( 6600 \) dollars.

answer:  First, we need to find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} = 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the children:
\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age} - \text{Total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene} = 20 - 7 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

answer:  To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the earnings per session.
2. Calculate the earnings per week.
3. Calculate the earnings per month.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings per session**

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is $25 + $1.50 * 10 = $25 + $15 = $40.

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings per week**

- The dance studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Therefore, the earnings per week are $40/session * 3 days/week = $120/week.

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings per month**

- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the earnings per month are $120/week * 4 weeks/month = $480/month.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.

answer:  To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for each step and then subtract that from the desired end time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

First, let's add up the total time required:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm is:

\boxed{2:00 pm}

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church next door is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church next door by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50 \text{ people}} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on patient rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients.
- Each round takes 20 minutes.
- Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
- Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's find the total time spent on rounds and appointments:
- Total time for rounds and appointments = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the remaining time available for updating records:
- Total time at the clinic = 9 hours = 540 minutes.
- Time spent on rounds and appointments = 480 minutes.
- Remaining time = 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes.

answer:  To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks and then sum them up.

1. **Red sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue sticks:**
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

So, they have a total of 34 sticks.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. The total population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year.

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines} = 30 \times 4 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Finally, we add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, after a year, there will be \boxed{1,490} porcupines in the park.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's boxes:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 \]
\[ P - M = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

\boxed{8}

answer:  On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
In total, Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.
The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so there are 18000 - 7500 - 4500 = 6000 gallons remaining.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the pool is) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 5.9:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost to fill the pool is $826.

answer:  To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Matteo's time: 4 hours

Distance traveled by Matteo = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Shandy's time: 10 hours

Distance traveled by Shandy = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo
Difference in distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The answer is \( \boxed{230} \).

answer:  First, calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine how many pieces Anne kept for herself:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, subtract the number of pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were given to her friends:
\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:
\[ 780 \text{ pieces} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

1. **Bethany's laps:**
   Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

2. **Trey's laps:**
   Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]

3. **Shaelyn's laps:**
   Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.

   \]

4. **Quinn's laps:**
   Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of laps Bethany can run and the number of laps Quinn can run:
\[
\text{Difference} = 10 - 5 = 5

answer:  First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:

1. She makes $10 per hour from wages.
2. She makes $15 per hour from tips.
3. She works 40 hours a week.

Weekly earnings from wages: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week
Weekly earnings from tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
Total weekly earnings: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for the down payment:

Down payment = 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Now, let's calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000:

Number of weeks = Down payment / Total weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

answer:  Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost is:
\[ 5 \times 9\% = 45\% \]

After the first 5 hours, the remaining charge is:
\[ x - 45\% \]

During the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost is:
\[ 3 \times 7\% = 21\% \]

After the next 3 hours, the remaining charge is:
\[ (x - 45\%) - 21\% = x - 66\% \]

We know that the remaining charge at the end is 28%:
\[ x - 66\% = 28\% \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 28\% + 66\% \]
\[ x = 94\% \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkout:**
   24 guests elected an early checkout.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkout:**
   15 guests elected for a late checkout.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-in:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]

5. **After dinner check-in:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner was served.
   \[
   61 + 30 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[

answer:  To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pictures in each album.
2. Determine the number of pictures in the selfie albums.
3. Determine the number of pictures in the portrait albums.
4. Add the number of selfies and portraits to find the total.

First, let's find the number of pictures in each album:
\[
\text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the number of pictures in the selfie albums:
\[
\text{Number of pictures in selfie albums} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

Then, we calculate the number of pictures in the portrait albums:
\[
\text{Number of pictures in portrait albums} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Finally, we add the number of selfies and portraits to find the total:
\[
\text{Total number of portraits and selfies} = 27 + 18 = 45
\]

So, Olivia had 45 portraits and selfies.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.5/peach = $1
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.5/pe = $2
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1/kiwi = $2
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Total cost of these fruits:
$1 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $8.75

Jamaar has $10, so he has:
$10 - $8.75 = $1.25 left

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with $1.25, we divide $1.25 by $0.25:
$1.25 / $0.25 = 5 plums

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 5 plums.

answer:  To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase each year starting from the initial price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   - Initial price: $120
   - Increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price: $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Initial price: $126
   - Increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Initial price: $132.30
   - Increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.61
   - New price: $132.30 + $6.61 = $139

answer:  To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one day:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

answer:  To determine how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages of his book. We know that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

First, let's find out how many pages James can read in 1 minute. If he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then he reads:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to read 18 pages. If he reads \(\frac{3}{10}\) pages per minute, then to read 18 pages, he will need:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ pages per minute}} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 6 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The answer is 60 minutes.

answer:  To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the cost per sandwich based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich should be the same for all packages. Therefore, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the package with 8 sandwiches:
- The cost per sandwich is $1.50.
- The package has 8 sandwiches.
- Total cost = Cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
- Total cost = $1.50 * 8
- Total cost = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

answer:  Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as \( S \). According to the problem, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of large stuffed animals she sold is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

Each small stuffed animal costs $4, and each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

The total earnings from the small stuffed animals is \( 4S \) dollars, and the total earnings from the large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times \frac{S}{2} = 6S \) dollars.

The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is \( 4S + 6S = 10S \) dollars.

We know that the total earnings is $120, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 10S = 120 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{120}{10} = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

answer:  First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

From selling cookies:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$80 \]

From selling cupcakes:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 \text{ per cupcake} = \$240 \]

Total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, let's determine how much Suzanne gave to her sisters. She gave each of her two sisters $10:
\[ 2 \text{ sisters} \times \$10 \text{ per sister} = \$20 \]

Now, subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

answer:  To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for the graduation.
2. Subtract the number of seats for faculty from the total number of seats.
3. Divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates.

First, let's find the total number of seats available:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 6000 \]

Next, subtract the number of seats for faculty:
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 6000 - 300 = 5700 \]

Now, divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{5700}{950} \]

To simplify the division, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 150:
\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{5700 \div 150}{950 \div 150} = 4 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive \(\boxed{4}\) tickets.

answer:  First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

One dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

In a month with 30 days, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds.

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore.

red balloons remaining.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]
yellow balloons remaining.

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, she added 6 blue balloons, making the total number of blue balloons:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]

Now, let's add up all the remaining balloons:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} = 42 \]

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total cost of bedroom set} - \text{Amount from selling old bedroom} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 3000 - 1000 \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine the monthly payment. Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \text{Remaining amount} \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 2000 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard needs to place.
2. Determine the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles:
- The driveway is 24 feet wide.
- Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.
- Therefore, the number of bottles is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next:
- It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
- Since there are 8 bottles, the total time is:
  \[
  8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Thus, it will take Richard a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

answer:  To determine Melissa's jury pay per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Subtract her daily parking expense from her daily pay.
3. Divide the net daily pay by the total number of hours to find the hourly pay.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's subtract her daily parking expense from her daily pay:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} - 3 \text{ dollars/day} = 12 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, we divide the net daily pay by the total number of hours to find the hourly pay:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars/day}}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa's jury pay per hour after expenses is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ dollars per hour} \]

answer:  To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario and then combine them.

1. **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50%
   - Probability of the substitute teacher not giving an extension: 100%
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(50\% \times 100\% = 50\%\)

2. **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher**
   - Probability of having a normal teacher: 50%
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60%
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20%
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(50\% \times 60\% \times 20\% = 12\%\)

Now, we add the probabilities of both scenarios to find the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[50\% + 12\% = 62\%\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 62%.

answer:  To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat.
2. Convert the number of medium-sized beans into small beans.

First, we know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:

\[ \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is:

\[ \text{Number of small beans} = 3 \times 150 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

answer:  First, determine the dimensions of each piece of fabric:
- The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.
- Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece of fabric = Length * Width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area needed = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

Next, calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18 \]

Now, add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total expenditure:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with \$50. Subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount she starts with:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Amor will have \$10 left to buy meat.

answer:  To determine how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the books:
- Ted buys 3 books.
- Each book costs $16.

So, the total cost of the books is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Ted buys 3 pencils.
- Each pencil costs $6.

So, the total cost of the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of money Jim will pay back in loans:
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, calculate the total amount of money Jim lost by not working during those 4 years:
$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

Now, add the loans and the lost income to find the total amount Jim needs to pay back:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

Jim's college degree tripled his income, so his new annual income is:
3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000, divide the total amount by his new annual income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income lost from not working during college.

answer:  To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for both the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- Number of people wanting chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $<<6.50*10=65>>65

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad: $6
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6/person = $<<6*6=36>>36

Now, we add the total costs for the chicken salad and the pasta salad:
- Total cost for chicken salad: $65
- Total cost for pasta salad: $36
- Total cost = $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101

Therefore, Molly will pay a total of $101 for the catering.

answer:  To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3x + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Rory retrieved 5 tennis balls in the second set. In the first set, he retrieved:
\[ x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 9 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

answer:  Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

answer:  To determine the average amount Johnny's dad lost or won, we need to calculate the total amount lost or won and then divide by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. Since he lost $5, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:
- Total lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5
- Total won: $11

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Average lost: \(\frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17\)

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $7.17.

1. Convert Xavier's height from feet to inches.
2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height.
3. Add the growth to Cole's initial height.
4. Calculate the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights.

1. Convert Xavier's height from feet to inches:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - Xavier's initial height = 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

2. Add the growth to Xavier's initial height:
   - Xavier's current height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

3. Add the growth to Cole's initial height:
   - Cole's current height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

4. Calculate the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
   - Difference = Cole's current height - Xavier's current height
   - Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

Therefore, the difference between Cole's height and Xavier's height now is 1 inch.

answer:  To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, let's find the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
- Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
- Over 30 days, she drinks:
  \[
  8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon:
- To convert 240 cups to gallons, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

answer:  To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
2. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter.

First, let's find the total number of hours worked by the team:

- The team worked for 3 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Each day, the team worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day, which is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 8 = 3\) hours.

So, the total number of hours worked by the team is:
\[ 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter:
\[ \frac{63}{4} = 15.75 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in 15.75 hours.

First, calculate the price of the car in 2008:
- Initial price: $20000
- Depreciation rate: 21% per year
- Depreciation amount: $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
- Price in 2008: $20000 - $4200 = $15800

Next, calculate the price of the car in 2009:
- Initial price: $15800
- Depreciation rate: 21% per year
- Depreciation amount: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318
- Price in 2009: $15800 - $3318 = $12482

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is:

\boxed{12482}

answer:  To determine how much James pays a year for his insurance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's find the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 per month.
- The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost.
- To find 60% of $120, we multiply $120 by 0.60:
  \[
  120 \times 0.60 = 72
  \]
- Therefore, the increased monthly cost is:
  \[
  120 + 72 = 192
  \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the increased monthly cost by 12:
- The increased monthly cost is $192.
- The annual cost is:
  \[
  192 \times 12 = 2304
  \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

answer:  To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum them up.

1. **Tank Top**: The cost of the tank top is $10.
2. **Running Shorts**: The cost of the running shorts is $5 more than the cost of the tank top. Therefore, the cost of the running shorts is $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis Shoes**: The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, and they are on sale for half price. Therefore, the sale price of the tennis shoes is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic Socks**: The cost of the athletic socks is $8, and she has a coupon for $2 off. Therefore, the cost of the athletic socks after the coupon is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we add up all the costs:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.

1. Calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven.
2. Subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City.

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven:

Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days:
\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City:
\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

answer:  To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day.

Each cat is fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/feed} \times 2 \text{ feeds/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Imma has 3 cats, so the total amount of cat food consumed by all three cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat/day} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

answer:  To determine the cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the kitchen floor.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the tiles.

1. The area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet.
2. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, the area of each tile is 1 square foot.
3. The number of tiles needed is the total area of the kitchen floor divided by the area of each tile:
   \[
   \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
   \]
4. The total cost of the tiles is the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400.

answer:  To determine how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one week and then multiply that by 4.

1. **Calculate the number of movies watched in one weekend:**
   - On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies on Sunday.
   - Therefore, in one weekend, they watch \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

2. **Calculate the number of movies watched in one week:**
   - There are 2 weekends in a week.
   - So, in one week, they watch \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) movies.

3. **Calculate the number of movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch 12 movies per week, in 4 weeks they will watch \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) movies.

Therefore, Jill and her friends can watch 48 movies in 4 weeks.

answer:  Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king-size bed every week.
Each twin bed has 2 sets of sheets, so 4 twin beds require 4 * 2 = 8 sets of sheets.
Each king-size bed has 2 sets of sheets, so 1 king-size bed requires 1 * 2 = 2 sets of sheets.
In total, Greg needs 8 + 2 = 10 sets of sheets per week.
His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.
So, he can wash 2 + 1 = 3 sets of sheets at a time.
To find out how many loads of laundry he does per week, we divide the total number of sheets he needs by the number of sheets his machine can wash at a time:
10 / 3 = 4 loads per week.
To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year:
4 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 208 loads per year.

answer:  To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response each day.
2. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
3. Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.

First, let's find the number of emails that don't require a response each day:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]
So, 16 emails don't require a response each day.

Next, let's find the number of emails that require a response each day:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]
So, 64 emails require a response each day.

Finally, let's calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]
So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The answer is 320.

answer:  To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the number of stickers he collected over the past three years to the number of stickers he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year.

First, let's calculate the number of stickers Leo collected this year:
- Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
- This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year: \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) stickers.

Now, let's add the number of stickers collected over the past three years:
- Two years ago, he had 100 stickers.
- Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
- This year, he collected 100 stickers.

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, Leo has a total of 250 stickers in his collection.

answer:  Let's denote the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal was 58 minutes long.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of slices in the 4 pizzas. Each pizza has 8 slices, so:
\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices and that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:
\[ 10 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:
\[ 7 \text{ slices} \times 2 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (Becky)} + 7 \text{ slices (Jake)} + 14 \text{ slices (Silvia)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ \boxed{31} \text{ slices} \]

answer:  First, determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, he wants to send out:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Next, calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the cost for 700 small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 0.05 = 350 \text{ cents} \]

Then, calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the cost for 1400 big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 0.15 = 2100 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons to find the total postage cost:
\[ 350 + 2100 = 2450 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 2450 cents on postage.

answer:  To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday: \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday: \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:
- Classmates: 25
- Girls in dance class: 7
- Family members: 13

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, subtract the number of people who said they could not come:
- People who cannot come: 4

Total guests = 45 - 4 = 41

Now, calculate the cost to rent the theater:
- Base fee for 20 guests: $125
- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

Total cost = $125 + (21 * $6) = $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost for the party is $251.

answer:  To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trucks dispatched.
2. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
4. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered by the successfully delivering trucks.

1. The total number of trucks dispatched is 20.
2. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks with mechanical failures is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
3. The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]
4. Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered by the successfully delivering trucks is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

answer:  First, calculate the number of pizzas the glee club ate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas the glee club has left:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, calculate the number of pizzas the football team ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, calculate the number of pizzas the football team ate:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, calculate the number of pizzas the football team has left:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, add the pizzas left from the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, there are 14 pizzas left.

answer:  First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten sub sandwiches:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the total number of meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

So, there were 28 meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

So, Sidney had 3 sub sandwiches left after Mark ate some.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, Sidney had a total of 6 sub sandwiches.

Finally, we calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, there were 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained.

The answer is 24.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the 15 roses. Each rose costs $2, so for 15 roses:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jenny has. She pays with five 5 dollar bills:

\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5 \text{ per bill} = \$25 \]

Now, let's find out how much change Jenny gets. Subtract the total cost of the roses from the total amount of money she has:

\[ \$25 - \$30 = \$5 \]

Jenny gets $5 in change. Since the florist only gives quarters as change, we need to determine how many quarters are equivalent to $5. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so we divide $5 by $0.25:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters.

\(\boxed{20}

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas available:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining 147 bananas each day.

answer:  First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he wants to make 6 dozen croissants, he needs:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to account for the promotion at the grocery store. The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means for every 2 pounds of butter, he only pays for 1 pound.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he will only pay for:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the butter. The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost for 3 pounds is:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

So, it will cost Dennis $12.00 to purchase the butter.

Riza spent one-third of her money:
\[ \text{Riza's spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money each person has left.

Maggie's remaining money:
\[ \text{Maggie's remaining money} = 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza's remaining money:
\[ \text{Riza's remaining money} = 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Finally, let's find the total amount of money the two of them have left:
\[ \text{Total remaining money} = \text{Maggie's remaining money} + \text{Riza's remaining money} = 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the two of them have left is \( \boxed{85} \).

answer:  The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, which is:

\[ 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:

\[ 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Price} - \text{Selling Price}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{2000 - 1800}{2000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = 10\% \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend received a 10% discount from the original price.

answer:  To determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we need to break down the problem into two steps:

1. Calculate the number of pieces Teddy placed in the first puzzle.
2. Calculate the number of pieces Teddy placed in the second puzzle.

First, let's find out how many pieces Teddy placed in the first puzzle. Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle:

\[ \text{Pieces in the first puzzle} = \frac{500}{2} = 250 \]

Next, let's find out how many pieces Teddy placed in the second puzzle. Teddy started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within the hour:

\[ \text{Pieces in the second puzzle} = 500 \]

Now, we add the number of pieces from both puzzles to find the total number of pieces placed during the hour:

\[ \text{Total pieces} = \text{Pieces in the first puzzle} + \text{Pieces in the second puzzle} = 250 + 500 = 750 \]

Therefore, Teddy placed a total of 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

answer:  To determine the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the intervals between each train's arrival and departure.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrival time: 10 minutes
   - Stay time: 20 minutes

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrival time: 30 minutes (half an hour)
   - Stay time: 5 minutes (a quarter of 20 minutes)

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrival time: 60 minutes (an hour)
   - Stay time: 0 minutes (leaves immediately)

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrival time: 80 minutes (an hour and 20 minutes)
   - Stay time: 20 minutes

Now, we sum up the intervals between each train's arrival and departure:

- First train to second train: 20 minutes
- Second train to third train: 20 minutes
- Third train to fourth train: 20 minutes

Total waiting time = 20 minutes + 20 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

   - Total revenue from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \)

3. Revenue from sodas:
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total revenue from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \)

Now, sum up the revenues from all the items:

\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

So, Terry makes a total of $162.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bananas Jenny buys. She buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, let's determine the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

answer:  To determine Frankie's score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Binkie's score.
2. Calculate Frankie's score based on the given relationship with Binkie's score.

Given:
- Binkie's score = 90
- Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.

Let's denote Frankie's score as \( F \).

According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this relationship as:
\[ F = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substitute Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Then, add 15 to 180:
\[ F = 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

answer:  To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved.
2. Determine how many more toothpicks she needs to save to reach 200.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks.

First, let's calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we determine how many more toothpicks she needs:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Finally, we calculate how many more weeks it will take to save 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

answer:  To determine how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 86400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 86400 seconds is:
   \[
   1 \text{ jellyfish/second} \times 86400 \text{ seconds} = 86400 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
   \[
   5 \text{ springs} \times 86400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} = 432000 \text{ jellyfish}

answer:  To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- The farmer works for 6 hours.
- Total bales produced by the farmer = 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- The truck works for 6 hours.
- Total bales picked up by the truck = 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
- Bales left in the field = 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales.

Therefore, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

answer:  To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate in inches per year.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate is:
\[ \text{Growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total growth over 13 years:
\[ \text{Total growth} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence between Sam and Harry is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Harry gets:
\[ S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we subtract Harry's share from the total amount:
\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

answer:  To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball was dropped.
2. Determine the height after the first bounce.
3. Determine the height after the second bounce.

First, let's find the initial height from which the ball was dropped:
- The ball was dropped from the third-floor balcony.
- Each story is 24 feet high.
- Therefore, the initial height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

Next, we calculate the height after the first bounce:
- The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
- Height after the first bounce = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

Finally, we calculate the height after the second bounce:
- The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height after the first bounce.
- Height after the second bounce = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

So, the final answer is 32 feet.

answer:  To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first train:**
   - Speed of the first train: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second train:**
   - Speed of the second train: Half of the first train's speed, which is 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

3. **Total distance between the two trains:**
   - Distance traveled by the first train: 180 miles
   - Distance traveled by the second train: 90 miles
   - Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart from each other.

The answer is 270 miles.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet.

Next, let's find the total area of all four walls:

- Total area = (2 * 80) + (2 * 40) = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required to cover 240 square feet. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet:

- Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

- Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

So, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, calculate the height of the second child:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

Then, calculate the height of the third child:
\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, calculate the height of the fourth child:
\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

answer:  Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( T \).

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it ate \( \frac{T}{2} \).
2. The remaining meat after the T-Rex ate was \( T - \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{2} \).
3. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{T}{2} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{4} \).
4. The remaining meat after the velociraptors ate was \( \frac{T}{2} - \frac{T}{4} = \frac{T}{4} \).
5. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so \( \frac{T}{4} = 270 \).

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ T = 1080 \]

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

answer:  To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest, we need to calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest waterslide: 60 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest waterslide: 80 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference in time = Time for biggest waterslide - Time for second biggest waterslide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest.

answer:  To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the cars and the number of people in the buses separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \( 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \).

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \( 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \).

Now, we add the number of people from the cars and the buses:
\[ 60 \text{ people} + 420 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

\boxed{480}

answer:  To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

First, let's calculate the total number of sodas left:
- Ellen started with 12 sodas.
- She shook 3 of them.
- She took 1 unshaken soda for herself.
- Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.

So, the total number of sodas left is:
\[ 12 - 3 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 5 \]

Next, let's determine the number of shaken sodas:
- Ellen shook 3 sodas initially.
- Her brother took 1 shaken soda.

So, the number of shaken sodas left is:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ Likelihood = \frac{2}{5} = 40\% \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so the total number of days is:

\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, Billy takes 10 days off. This means he helps people for:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day. Therefore, he can help:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Over 40 days, he helps:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, Billy helps 240 people.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( x \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{x}{5} \]

A third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \]

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

answer:  To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Micah ran.
2. Subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find Ahito's distance.

Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = \text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, Martha's age is:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

So, Jeff is 30 years old.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:

Total time for 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours:

Total time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

answer:  To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } P = 240 \]

We can write this as:
\[ 0.40P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = P - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

#### 360.

answer:  Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.
She wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, so she needs to save a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.
Lauren is saving 20% of her paycheck, so she saves $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.
To save $800,000, she needs to work for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

answer:  Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so she subtracted $15.00 from her balance:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discounted price of the frying pan is:

$20.00 * 0.80 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discounted price of the towels is:

$30.00 * 0.90 = $27.00

The total cost of the frying pan and the towels is:

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is:

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

#### $113.00.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = \$27\)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = \$55\)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = \$75\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
\[
\$27 \text{ (red balls)} + \$55 \text{ (blue balls)} + \$75 \text{ (green balls)} = \$157
\]

Therefore, the store will have received \$157 after all the balls are sold.

answer:  To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:

- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
  \[
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[
12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we divide the total height by the number of women (which is 6, since there are 3 women wearing each type of heel):
\[
\frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the cocktail party is 3 inches.

\[ \text{Length of each part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeters into 5 equal parts.

\[ \text{Length of each new part} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

answer:  To determine how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the pots and garden soil before applying the coupon.
2. Subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost.

Let's start with the first step:

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.

So, the total cost before applying the coupon is:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

answer:  Anna had a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left.

She bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book as \( x \).

The total cost of the two books is \( 2x \).

After buying the books, Anna has $2 left in her budget. Therefore, the total amount she spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

answer:  Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. She plans to hike twice a day, each time covering 125 miles.

First, let's calculate the total distance she plans to hike in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ hikes/day} \times 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's determine how many more miles she needs to hike to reach 9,300 miles:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's calculate how many more miles she needs to hike per day:
\[ 1800 \text{ miles} \div 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

1. Calculate the amount of apples Peter wants.
2. Calculate the amount of apples Paul wants.
3. Subtract the total amount wanted by Peter and Paul from the total amount of apples.

First, calculate the amount of apples Peter wants:
\[ \text{Peter's apples} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Next, calculate the amount of apples Paul wants:
\[ \text{Paul's apples} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, calculate the total amount of apples wanted by Peter and Paul:
\[ \text{Total apples wanted by Peter and Paul} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Finally, subtract the total amount wanted by Peter and Paul from the total amount of apples:
\[ \text{Apples left} = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

answer:  To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's work:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's work:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan took 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours to walk the dog.

3. **Dior's work:**
   - Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior took 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we sum up the time taken by all three:
- Amalia's time: 4 hours
- Megan's time: 6 hours
- Dior's time: 8 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

So, the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

answer:  To determine how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} \approx 9.02 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take approximately 9.02 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

answer:  To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to determine the weight of each dog and then sum them up.

1. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
2. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}

answer:  To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days.
2. Determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.

First, let's calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days:
Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days.
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days. Let \( B \) be the distance Brian will walk in seven days.
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

\[ \boxed{35} \]

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's add the new fish Tate buys:
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Finally, let's find the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11
- Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16

Tate has 16 - 11 = 5 more female fish than male fish.

The answer is 5.

answer:  First, we need to determine the distance to John's parents' house. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to find the total distance he drives in a month. The round trip distance is twice the distance to his parents' house:

\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 2 \times \text{Distance to parents' house} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

answer:  To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the average car.
2. Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
3. Calculate the speed of the fastest car based on the speed of the 2nd fastest car.

1. The speed of the average car is given as 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
   \[
   5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
   \[
   1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{750 \text{ miles per hour}}

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
2 workers * 6 toys/hour = 12 toys/hour

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
2 workers * 4 toys/hour = 8 toys/hour

Total production rate of the first four workers:
12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

In a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

By the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced:
200 toys + 20 toys = 220 toys

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so their production rate is:
220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys/hour

Thus, the fifth worker produces 22 toys per hour.

The answer is 22 toys per hour.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is \( \frac{S}{4} \). Therefore, Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which is \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.

Since Luis gave \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris and Kris received 16 stickers, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is \( \boxed{64} \).

answer:  First, determine the length of the tree that John can use for logging:
\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate how many 4-foot logs he can cut from the 64 feet of wood:
\[ 64 \text{ feet} \div 4 \text{ feet/log} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, he cuts 5 planks:
\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

He then sells each plank for $1.2:
\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes $96.

answer:  Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \), the number of eggs painted by Camden as \( C \), and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + A = 56 \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)
3. \( C = S + 12 \)

Substituting the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) into the third equation:
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
\[ A = 18 \]

Now, we find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 18 = 3 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 3 more Easter eggs than Arnold.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the Earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, let's calculate half of the circumference of the Earth:
\[ \text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

\[ 50 \text{ days} \]

answer:  Let's denote Vince's current age as \( V \).

Liam is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, Liam was:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Now, solve for \( V \):
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

answer:  To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 trees that each have 7 blue birds:
   \[
   3 \text{ trees} \times 7 \text{ blue birds/tree} = 21 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

2. For the 2 trees that each have 4 blue birds:
   \[
   2 \text{ trees} \times 4 \text{ blue birds/tree} = 8 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

3. For the 1 tree that has 3 blue birds:
   \[
   1 \text{ tree} \times 3 \text{ blue birds/tree} = 3 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds:
\[
21 \text{ blue birds} + 8 \text{ blue birds} + 3 \text{ blue birds} = 32 \text{ blue birds}
\]

The final answer is 32.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time she spends walking on the beach and the time she spends walking on the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - She spends 40 minutes on the beach.

2. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
   - Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach.
   - If her speed on the beach is 1 mile per 40 minutes, then her speed on the sidewalk is 1 mile per 20 minutes.
   - To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, she takes 20 minutes.

3. **Total time for the walk:**
   - Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time spent on the sidewalk: 20 minutes
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

#### 60 minutes.

answer:  First, determine the number of boxes needed:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons per box}} = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce per crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons and boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces per box} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  If Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns, then her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10000 per month.
The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.
If their mother earns twice their combined salary, then she earns 2 * $15000 = $30000 per month.
The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 per month.

answer:  To determine the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Divide the discounted total cost by the number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount:
- Each pack costs $10.00.
- Total cost for 4 packs = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, apply the 10% discount:
- Discount amount = $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00.
- Discounted total cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Finally, divide the discounted total cost by the number of bagels:
- Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

Therefore, each single bagel will cost $1.00.

answer:  Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is:
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, he pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into the bottle, making the total temperature of the water in the bottle:
\[ 132 + T \text{ degrees} \]

Donny can only drink the water if it is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ 132 + T \geq 40 \]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \) of the second mug, we solve the inequality:
\[ 132 + T \geq 40 \]
\[ T \geq 40 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq -92 \]

Thus, the temperature of the second mug must be at least -92 degrees.

answer:  To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28:
\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

answer:  Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Next, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade.

First, let's find out how many lemons Tim collects in one year:
- Tim grows 5 trees.
- Each tree produces 6 lemons per year.

So, the number of lemons Tim collects in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, let's find out how many lemons Tim collects in a decade:
- There are 10 years in a decade.
- Tim collects 30 lemons per year.

So, the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
\[3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\]

Next, calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
\[5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
\[90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\]

Finally, convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[240 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 20 \text{ dozens}\]

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period.

1. **Cows added:**
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
   - There are 21 days in three weeks.
   - Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

2. **Chickens added:**
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
   - There are 21 days in three weeks.
   - Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

3. **Total number of animals:**
   - Initial cows: 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows
   - Initial chickens: 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens
   - Total number of animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700 animals.

answer:  First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops} \]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes} \]
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops} \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Therefore, it takes:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:
\[ 18 \text{ scoops} \times 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} = 27 \text{ potatoes} \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Number of days for 45 large-sized picture scenes: \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Number of days for 36 medium-sized picture scenes: \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Number of days for 49 small-sized picture scenes: \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, add up the days for each type:
\[ 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \]

So, it will take Lauren a total of 22 days to create all of the picture scenes.

answer:  First, determine the number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day.
- Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, determine the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day.
- Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Now, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Finally, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers.
- Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

Answer: 291 sunflowers.

1. Identify the number of green jelly beans.
2. Calculate the number of red jelly beans.
3. Determine the total number of green and red jelly beans.
4. Subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans to find the number of blue jelly beans.

1. The number of green jelly beans is given as 17.
2. The number of red jelly beans is twice the number of green jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of green and red jelly beans is:
   \[
   17 + 34 = 51
   \]
4. The total number of jelly beans is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:
   \[
   60 - 51 = 9
   \]

Therefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9. Let's denote the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\).

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84:
\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]
\[ 14x = 84 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, the number of men is:
\[ 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

And the number of women is:
\[ 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Next, we need to account for the 20 women who alight from the bus:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 34 \]

answer:  To find the average speed, we need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Sid took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles.
- Sid took 3 hours to travel the additional 140 miles.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

answer:  To determine how many eggs each child receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Chatty prepared.
2. Divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, let's find the total number of eggs:
- Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
- One dozen equals 12 eggs.
- Therefore, three dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:
- Chatty has four children.
- So, each child receives \(\frac{36}{4} = 9\) eggs.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

answer:  To find the total duration of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of each song and then add them together.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total duration of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is 13 minutes.

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected:
\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{\text{Carlos's seashells}}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells collected:
\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Since they divided the seashells equally, each person gets:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \] seashells

answer:  Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had:

\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \]

Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has:

\[ 6 + 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

answer:  To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

1. The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, which is 0.20 in decimal form.
2. The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely than the first ticket, which means it is 3 times the probability of the first ticket.

So, the probability of the second ticket winning is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:

- 3/4 of the 8 babies are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of the 8 babies are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies wearing bows:

- All 2 babies dressed in blue wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 babies dressed in purple wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

- The number of babies wearing purple bows is 2.
- The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.

The probability is \( \frac{2}{4} \times 100\% = 50\% \).

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

answer:  To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Ned's height:**
   - Isabel is 7 feet tall.
   - Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.
   - Therefore, Ned's height is:
     \[
     \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine Carl's height:**
   - Carl is one foot taller than Ned.
   - Therefore, Carl's height is:
     \[
     \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the length of Carl's cane:**
   - Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
   - Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:
     \[
     \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] feet.

answer:  To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his carrot consumption into weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).

So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- Mason eats 5 carrots each weekend day.
- There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).

So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Finally, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends to find the total weekly consumption:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

answer:  Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which is $40. Therefore, he makes a profit of $40 - $20 = $20 per device.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so he made a profit of 2 * $20 = $40.

Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so he made a profit of 4 * $20 = $80.

In total, Linus made a profit of $40 + $80 = $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

answer:  To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of face masks used per day:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - He goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, the number of face masks used per day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ masks per outing} \times 3 \text{ outings per day} = 6 \text{ masks per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - If he uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days he will use:
     \[
     6 \text{ masks per day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
     \]

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

answer:  Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, so he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters for $50.
After selling 40 square meters, he had 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.
After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, so he sold 40 / 4 = 10 square meters for $30.
After selling 10 square meters, he had 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.
He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 30 * $3 = $90.
In total, he earned $50 + $30 + $90 = $170 after selling all his unused land.

answer:  To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, each bottle covers 0.20 of a person's daily energy needs.

To cover the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 0.20 \text{ bottles/person} = 4600 \text{ bottles} \]

The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles currently produced from the total number of bottles required:
\[ 4600 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 400 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 400 more bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

answer:  To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of reports received last week.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total reports received last week: 5168
2. Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
3. Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Next, subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining reports:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.

- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each:
  \[
  200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
  \]

- The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined:
  \[

  \]

Next, let's find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
\[
400 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}
\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex:
\[
1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ apartments per week}
\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment:
\[
3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars per week}

answer:  To determine Geb's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Haley's age.
2. Calculate half of Haley's age.
3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age.

Given:
- Haley is 26 years old.

Step 1: Identify Haley's age.
Haley's age = 26

Step 2: Calculate half of Haley's age.
Half of Haley's age = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\)

Step 3: Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age.
Geb's age = \(13 - 10 = 3\)

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of eggs hidden in the yard:
\[ 3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, determine the number of eggs each person finds:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy: \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) eggs.

Now, add up the total number of eggs found:
\[ 5 \text{ (Lamar)} + 10 \text{ (Stacy)} + 8 \text{ (Charlie)} + 4 \text{ (Mei)} = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 \text{ (total hidden)} - 27 \text{ (found)} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
- Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet.
- Area of one bedroom = 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms:
- Total area of bedrooms = 4 bedrooms * 240 square feet per bedroom = 960 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the area of the living room:
- The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
- Area of the living room = 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of the bedrooms and the living room:
- Total area of bedrooms and living room = 960 square feet + 1200 square feet = 2160 square feet.

Finally, let's add the area of the rest of the house:
- Total area of the house = 2160 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Rissa was given as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Let's denote the amount of money Rissa gave to her sister as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister.

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his little sister.

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, Ronnie is left with:

\[

answer:  To find the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
5. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:

50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350 fruits

answer:  Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters.

According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + (B + 7) + 4B = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Next, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the second half:
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores (1/4) * 2 = 1 goal.
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams:
- Total goals scored by team A: 4 (first half) + 1 (second half) = 5 goals.
- Total goals scored by team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 5 (team A) + 10 (team team B) = 15 goals.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + (0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods}) = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, the cost per pod is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 100 \text{ cycles} \]

answer:  Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint used as \( x \) pints each. According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.

Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is \( \frac{x}{2} \) pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is given as 12 pints. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3x + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]

\[ \frac{6x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]

\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 12 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ 7x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 4 \) pints.

answer:  To determine the total number of clouds Alice counts over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 \]

Therefore, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of \(93\) puffs of clouds.

answer:  To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed (drilled and capped).
2. Divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has.
3. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

First, let's calculate the total number of teeth fixed:
- The dentist drills 4 teeth.
- The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which is 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

So, the total number of teeth fixed is 4 + 11 = 15.

Next, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has:
\[ \frac{15}{30} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Finally, we multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

answer:  First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially has:
\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ bills} \]

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount of money by 5:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ bills} \]

So, Thomas has 12 5 dollar bills.

answer:  First, let's determine how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the 5-inch piece:

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

So, the amount of chalk left after Monday is:

\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher normally uses 20% of the chalk each day:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches:

\[ \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ inch/day}} = 2.75 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2.75 days before recycling the piece of chalk.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head.
3. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
4. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
5. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
6. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.

Now, let's add up all the apples:

- Apples that fell out of the tree: 2
- Apples that landed on Newton's head: 1
- Apples that Newton put in his pocket: 1
- Apples that fell out of the tree after Newton threw the apple: 5
- Apples that fell out of the tree after Newton threw the remaining apple: 6

Adding these up:

\[ 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 = 15 \]

So, Newton brought home a total of 15 apples.

answer:  Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \).

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Wendy will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]
   Substituting \( W \) from the first equation:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3}
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 3:
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5C + 35
   \]
   Subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:
   \[
   2C = 40
   \]
   So:
   \[
   C = 20
   \]

answer:  To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the quantity of sour milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:
\[ \text{Amount of sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, calculate the refund amount based on the quantity of sour milk:
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received \$5600 in refunds.

answer:  Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, so in 60 minutes, he can build 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.
However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, 2 snowballs / 15 minutes * 60 minutes = 8 snowballs melt.
Therefore, in 60 minutes, Jay will have 20 snowballs - 8 snowballs = 12 snowballs.
To have 60 snowballs, Jay needs to build 60 snowballs - 12 snowballs = 48 snowballs.
Since he builds 1/3 snowballs per minute, it will take him 48 snowballs / (1/3 snowballs per minute) = 144 minutes to build 48 snowballs.
Therefore, it will take Jay 144 minutes + 60 minutes = 204 minutes to have 60 snowballs.
Since 204 minutes is 3 hours 4 minutes, it will take Jay 3 hours to have 60 snowballs.

answer:  To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices required by her friends.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. Therefore, each friend eats:
\[ 6 \text{ cheese slices} + 4 \text{ pepperoni slices} = 10 \text{ slices per friend} \]

Kate has 6 friends, so the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 10 \text{ slices per friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, and each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. However, since the problem does not specify which type of pizza to buy, we will assume Kate needs to buy enough pizzas to cover the total number of slices.

To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 5 \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 5 pizza pies.

answer:  To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can receive.

First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000 \text{ dollars}}{500 \text{ dollars/book}} \times 100 \text{ dollars/book} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:

\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} = 1800 \text{ books/school} \]

Therefore, Bob can buy \boxed{900} books per school.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Ali's order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags of coal needed.
2. Determine the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of 50 kg bags needed:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per bag}} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} \]

\[ \text{Number of bags} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306.

answer:  To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate both the cost of the haircut and the cost of the hair coloring.

1. **Cost of the haircut:**
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.
   - The length of hair cut is \( 10 - 8 = 2 \) inches.
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the hair coloring:**
   - The cost of the hair coloring is given as $40.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the hair coloring.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 60 + 40 = 100 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of May's hair cut and color is $100.

answer:  To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
2. Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
3. Calculate Jim's current age based on the information given.

1. John's current age is 28 years old. Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, John's age when Digimon came out was:
   \[
   28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim's age when Digimon came out was:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, Jim's current age is:
   \[
   4 + 20 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

So, Jim is currently 24 years old.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]

answer:  To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at each stage.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people entered initially, three times that number is \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) people.

Now, we add up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

answer:  First, let's calculate Jason's weekly earnings for each task:

- Emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 per time = $3.00
- Doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 per time = $3.00
- Taking the trash: 2 times * $0.75 per time = $1.50
- Cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 per time = $1.50

Now, let's sum up his weekly earnings:

Weekly earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Next, let's calculate his total earnings for the two-week period:

Total earnings = $9.00 per week * 2 weeks = $18.00

answer:  Let's denote the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day as \( x \).

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages left.

On the second day, they used 30 bandages. So, they had \( (x + 12) - 30 = x - 18 \) bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had \( (x - 18) + 100 - 25 = x + 57 \) bandages left.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Therefore:
\[ x + 57 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 21 \]

So, the nurses started with 21 bandages on the first day. #### 21

answer:  First, calculate Jen's weekly earnings:
- She works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Weekly earnings without bonus = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = $135/week

Next, add the bonus for complete attendance:
- She receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.

Weekly earnings with bonus = $135/week + $10/week = $145/week

Now, calculate her total earnings for April:
- There are 4 weeks in April.

Total earnings for April = $145/week * 4 weeks = $580

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
   - His children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons.

4. **Fourth Day:**
   - There are 3 people at the party.
   - They share the remaining root beer equally.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons.

So, each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons of root beer.

To express this as a decimal:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons} \]

Each person gets approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

answer:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600/10 = $<<600/10=60>>60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 bottles.
The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so it is $60 + ($60*0.5) = $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90 per bottle.

The total cost for the scotch is 10*$60 = $<<10*60=600>>600.
The total cost for the cognac is 20*$90 = $<<20*90=1800>>1800.

Therefore, John spends $600+$1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400 on everything.

answer:  To determine the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of blood one whale has.
2. Calculate the amount of blood one shark has.
3. Multiply the amount of blood one shark has by the number of sharks.

Step 1: Each whale has 40 gallons of blood.

Step 2: A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Therefore, the amount of blood one shark has is:
\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood per whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 3: To find the total amount of blood for ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by the number of sharks:
\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = \text{Blood per shark} \times \text{Number of sharks} = 120 \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, ten sharks in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) packs of black pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

Now, we sum the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens Alain has:
- Total pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
- Total pens = 25 + 50 = 75

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

answer:  Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we calculate how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish with either red stripes or blue stripes is 42.

answer:  On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted over the two days, we add the number of trees planted on each day:
- First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
- Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

Total trees planted = 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140 trees.

answer:  Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can write this as an equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

answer:  First, we need to find the total weight of all the tunas Deandre caught.

The first tuna weighs 56 kg.
The second tuna weighs 46 kg.
The third tuna weighs 26 kg.

Adding these together:
\[ 56 \, \text{kg} + 46 \, \text{kg} + 26 \, \text{kg} = 138 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.

\[ 138 \, \text{kg} \times \$0.50/\text{kg} = \$69 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $69 after selling all the tunas to the market.

answer:  To determine how many miles the last dog needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of exercise required for all four dogs and then subtract the known amounts.

The average amount of exercise needed for the four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total amount of exercise needed for all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the exercise needs of the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total exercise needs of the first three dogs from the total exercise needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

answer:  Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so she had:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so she had:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

Total colors from the palettes and makeup sets:
\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she now has:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

After using half of the colors from one makeup set, she has:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ colors} \]

So, Amy has 7 eyeshadow colors left. #### 7

answer:  To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of medicine in one dosage.

Given:
- 14 mL of the first medicine
- 3 times that amount of the second medicine

First, calculate the amount of the second medicine:
\[ \text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of medicine in one dosage:
\[ \text{Total medicine per dosage} = 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ \text{Total medicine in 8 doses} = 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each speed and then sum them up.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 1 liter
   - Time run: 3 days
   - Total water removed on low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 2 liters (twice the low setting)
   - Time run: 3 days
   - Total water removed on medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

3. **High setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 4 liters (twice the medium setting)
   - Time run: 5 days
   - Total water removed on high setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we sum up the water removed at each speed:
3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

The total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier is 29 liters.

answer:  First, calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[ \text{Loan} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, determine how much John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts:

\[ \text{Amount paid off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Finally, calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts:

\[ \text{Leftover money} = \text{Loan} - \text{Amount paid off debts} \]
\[ \text{Leftover money} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

answer:  To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price:

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

answer:  First, calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume = length * width * height = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

Next, calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
Number of jelly beans = Volume / Volume of one jelly bean = 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 3600 jelly beans

Now, account for the packing efficiency:
Effective number of jelly beans = Number of jelly beans * Packing efficiency = 3600 jelly beans * 0.80 = 2880 jelly beans

Finally, calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = Effective number of jelly beans * Percentage of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the estimated number and the true number is:
Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans = 900 - 864 = 36

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount he needs to repay is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount after 11 months is:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Stephen will pay this remaining amount in the twelfth month:

\[ \text{Amount to Pay in Twelfth Month} = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

answer:  To determine how many balloons were thrown, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons initially.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons to find out how many balloons were thrown.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons initially:
- There are 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.

So, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

answer:  To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes and then add it to the capacity of Ali's class.

Given:
- Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
- Each of John's classes has a capacity that is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class.

First, calculate the capacity of one of John's classes:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is \( \boxed{150} \).

answer:  To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each wooden table costs $20.

So, the cost of the wooden tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times \$20 \text{ per table} = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.

So, the cost of the roof frames is:
\[ 2 \text{ frames} \times \$10 \text{ per frame} = \$20 \]

Now, we add the costs of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
\[ \$80 + \$20 = \$100 \]

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100.

answer:  For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum three times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. Therefore, the total cost for the first 5 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2 \text{ per visit} \times 5 \text{ years} = \$30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%, so the new cost per visit is:

\[ \$2 \text{ per visit} \times 2.5 = \$5 \text{ per visit} \]

The total cost for the next 3 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5 \text{ per visit} \times 3 \text{ years} = \$45 \]

To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we add the cost of the first 5 years and the cost of the next 3 years:

\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

Therefore, Pauline spent \$75 on all visits to the museum.

answer:  To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes needed for all the children.
2. Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes.
3. Subtract the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes from the total to find out how many diapers Jordan changes.

First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed for all the children:
- Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
- Jordan has 2 children.
- Total diaper changes per day = 5 diaper changes/child * 2 children = 10 diaper changes.

Next, let's determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes:
- Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
- Half of 10 diaper changes = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

Finally, we subtract the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes from the total to find out how many diapers Jordan changes:
- Jordan's diaper changes = Total diaper changes - Wife's diaper changes = 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes.

Jordan changes 5 diaper changes per day.

answer:  When the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people on the bus 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. So, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus, making the total number of people on the bus 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, making the total number of people on the bus 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of empty spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

To fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need 20 more people.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 180 + 20 = 200.

The answer is 20.

answer:  To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The cost for 16 minutes at $0.25 per minute is:
     \[
     16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25 \text{ per minute} = \$4.00
     \]

2. **Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:**
   - The cost for 20 minutes at $0.2 per minute is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2 \text{ per minute} = \$4.00
     \]

3. **Total cost of the 36-minute call:**
   - Add the cost of the first 16 minutes to the cost of the remaining 20 minutes:
     \[
     \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00
     \]

Therefore, a 36-minute call would cost $8.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Total pounds of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Total tablespoons of seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

answer:  To determine how long it will take for all students to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups are needed to accommodate all students.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

1. **Total number of students:**
   - There are 4 grades (grades 4-7).
   - Each grade has 10 students with the most points.
   - Total students = 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students.

2. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Each group can accommodate 8 students.
   - Number of groups = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

3. **Total time required:**
   - Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room.
   - Total time = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for all the students to try the escape room.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ \text{Length of the longer piece} = 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

answer:  To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each type of magazine and then sum them up.

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

Since each magazine corresponds to one issue, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is equal to the total number of issues:
\[
66 \text{ magazines}
\]

Therefore, Susan gets a total of 66 magazines every year.

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 10 + 2 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

So, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ C = <<3=3>>3 \]

answer:  On Monday, it rained 2 inches. On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount it rained on Monday.

Twice the amount it rained on Monday is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Adding 1 inch to this amount:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, it is expected to rain 5 inches on Tuesday.

answer:  To find the mean score, add all the scores together and then divide by the number of quizzes.

First, add all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60

Let's add them step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, divide this sum by the number of quizzes (which is 9):
630 / 9 = 70

Therefore, Sally's mean score is 70.

answer:  To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price in December.
2. Calculate the price in January.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December**

The price in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

So, the price in December is $72.

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January**

The price in December was $72. In January, the price decreased by 50%.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is $36.

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is **$36**.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure without the discount:

- Basic cost of Manicure: $35
- Basic cost of Pedicure: $40
- Total without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we apply the 20% discount:

- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Total with discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art for each hand:

- Cost of nail art per nail: $3
- Total cost of nail art for 10 nails (5 fingers per hand * 2 hands): $3/nail * 10 nails = $30

Finally, we add up all the costs:

- Total cost of Manicure and Pedicure with discount: $60
- Total cost of nail art: $30
- Total amount Karen would pay: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $90.

answer:  To determine how many paintings Kim has, we need to work backwards from the information given:

1. Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
3. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim.

First, let's find out how many paintings Shelley has:
- Samantha has 27 paintings.
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
- Therefore, Shelley has \( 27 + 12 = 39 \) paintings.

Next, let's find out how many paintings Kim has:
- Shelley has 39 paintings.
- Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim.
- Therefore, Kim has \( 39 - 8 = 31 \) paintings.

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he travels for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Michael has traveled:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

After eating 24 apples, Walter has:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples remaining}
\]

Next, we calculate how many apples Walter gave to his sister. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, Walter has:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples remaining}
\]

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples.

\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total earnings from the veteran lessons. Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons at his reduced rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from veteran lessons} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Charlie will make a total of $440 for the day.

answer:  To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of pomelos Eve originally had.
2. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve has left after giving some away.
3. Subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number to find out how many she gave away.

1. Eve originally had 20 pomelos.
2. After giving some away, she is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her original pomelos. To find \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 20, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.
3. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The answer is \( \boxed{15} \).

answer:  To determine the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent cleaning all the classrooms.
2. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
3. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.

First, let's calculate the total time spent cleaning all the classrooms:
- Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean.
- There are 80 classrooms.
- Total time = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes.

Next, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 1200 minutes = 1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours.

Now, calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms:
- The custodian works an 8-hour day.
- Total time spent cleaning = 20 hours.
- Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100% = 250%.

Therefore, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms.

answer:  To determine how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year.

According to the problem, Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the number of novels she has written this year. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother:**
   - Madeline ate 6 grapes.
   - Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.
   - Therefore, her brother used \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.

2. **Calculate the total number of grapes used for the pies:**
   - The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie.
   - Their mother made 4 pies.
   - Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) grapes.

3. **Calculate the total number of grapes at the beginning:**
   - Madeline used 6 grapes.
   - Her brother used 30 grapes.
   - Their mother used 48 grapes.
   - Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \( 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \) grapes.

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(\boxed{102}\).

answer:  To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the bag.
2. Divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.

First, let's find the discounted price of the bag:
- Original price per bag: $18.00
- Discount per bag: $3.00
- Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Next, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick:
- Number of sticks per bag: 30
- Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50

Finally, we convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents:
- Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 cents/dollar = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of beef jerky will cost 50 cents.

answer:  To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the eggs.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the eggs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs.
- Each dozen costs $2.40.
- Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00.

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs.
- Each dozen has 12 eggs, so 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.
- Total revenue = 60 eggs * $1/3 eggs = $20.00.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

So, Rose's profit is \boxed{8.00}.

answer:  To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients.
2. Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese: Twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00

Weekly cost = Pasta + Cheddar cheese + Gruyere cheese
Weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
Weekly cost = $10.00

Next, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
Annual cost = Weekly cost * 52
Annual cost = $10.00 * 52
Annual cost = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

answer:  To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase.

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
   \]

3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
   \]

Now, we add up the capacities of all shelves:
\[
20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[
110 \div 55 = 2
\]

Elly needs 2 bookcases.

answer:  Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
After dropping 5 marbles, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left.
He then picked up 3 more marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
However, one of the marbles he picked up wasn't a marble, so he got rid of it.
Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for the blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

answer:  To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests.

First, let's find out how many questions she answered correctly on the first test:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 70 = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of questions on both tests:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly:
\[ 70\% \text{ of } 110 = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum them up.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) minutes.
3. The third side takes twice as long as the first side, so it also takes \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) minutes.
5. The fifth side takes half as long as the first side, so it also takes \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) minutes.

Now, we add up the times for all six sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so each person has 1 flashlight.
- Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms.

Total flashlights = 4 people * 1 flashlight/person + 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights

Next, calculate the total number of candles:
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms have 4 small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms have 5 medium candles.

Total candles = 4 rooms * 4 candles/room + 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 16 + 20 = 36 candles

Finally, add the total number of flashlights and candles to find the total number of candles and flashlights combined:

Total candles and flashlights = Total flashlights + Total candles = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56

answer:  To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in four years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game.

First, let's calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years:
- She plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game:
- She scores 21 points per game.

So, the total number of points is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ 3360 \text{ points} \]

answer:  To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to buy 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 customer buys a car.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs:
     \[
     15 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ customers per car} = 30 \text{ customers}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs:
     \[
     30 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls per customer} = 750 \text{ telephone calls}
     \]

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

Therefore, the number of telephone calls is:
\[
\boxed{750}
\]

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of water needed for each type of plant:

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
   \[
   4 \text{ plants} \times 0.5 \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. For the remaining 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

Now, add up the amounts of water needed for all the plants:
\[
2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day to water all her plants.

answer:  To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to find the number of helmets, robots, and footballs and then sum them up.

1. **Number of helmets:**
   Dominick saw 20 helmets.

2. **Number of robots:**
   Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Number of footballs:**
   Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total number of items:**
   To find the total number of items, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs:
   \[
   20 \text{ (helmets)} + 10 \text{ (robots)} + 40 \text{ (footballs)} = 70
   \]

Thus, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.

answer:  To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of doughnuts made each day.
2. Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the doughnuts.

First, let's calculate the number of doughnuts made each day:
- Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- 1 dozen = 12 doughnuts.
- Therefore, 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, let's determine the total number of doughnuts made in June:
- June has 30 days.
- So, the total number of doughnuts made in June = 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the doughnuts:
- Each doughnut is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue = 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

 Derrick makes $7200 in June.

answer:  To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs.**
Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks.

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.**
Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:
\[
\frac{56}{8} = 7
\]
So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks.**
Each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
\[
7 \times 2 = 14
\]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is \(\boxed{14}\).

Next, calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:
\[ 6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, find the difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry than with the old varnish.

answer:  First, calculate the distance Phineas needs to travel on land and in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water:

- Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
- Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
- Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

- Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
- Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, add the times for both parts of the journey to find the total time:

- Total time = Time on land + Time in water
- Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

answer:  To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach for the week, we need to calculate the number of people each day and then sum them up.

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
2. On the second day, he saw 20 more people than the first day, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
3. On the third day, he saw twice the number of people as the second day, so he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.
4. For the remaining 4 days, he saw an average of 60 people each day, so he saw 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, we add up the number of people seen each day:
- First day: 50 people
- Second day: 70 people
- Third day: 140 people
- Remaining 4 days: 240 people

Total number of people for the week = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, let's add up the total weekly cost:

$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00 per week

Next, let's calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:

$47.00 per week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to consider both the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.

Given:
- The main phone costs $20.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \).

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we have:
\[ 20 = 2x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

There are four additional phones in the plan. Therefore, the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the total cost of the phone plan is $60.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]

answer:  To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade uploads in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day:
- Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

So, the number of photos uploaded in one day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos:
- Jade has 210 photos in total.
- She uploads 42 photos each day.

So, the number of days required is:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos.

answer:  To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by each type of animal and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
   - There are 10 2-legged animals.
   - Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
   - Total legs from 2-legged animals = 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs.

2. Calculate the number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   - There are 15 4-legged animals.
   - Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
   - Total legs from 4-legged animals = 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs.

3. Add the total number of legs from both types of animals:
   - Total legs = Legs from 2-legged animals + Legs from 4-legged animals
   - Total legs = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 80.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, for 4 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need:

\[ 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Now, let's consider the extra gallon of lemonade for Allen. Since the extra gallon is twice as tart as the other gallons, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. Therefore, we will need:

\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons} \]

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:

\[ 24 \text{ lemons} + 12 \text{ lemons} = 36 \text{ lemons} \]

answer:  John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster. 

First, let's calculate his new speed after training:
\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \text{ WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words:
\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \text{ pages} \times 450 \text{ words/page} = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages after his training.

answer:  First, let's calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount popped: \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the past 30 seconds popped: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, Garrett has to eat 210 pieces of popcorn in total.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of orange candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108 \]

Next, let's determine the number of yellow candies. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, let's find the total number of candies that are either red, orange, or yellow. We add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

\[ \text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

Finally, to find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:

\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43 \]

Therefore, there are 43 candies that are pink.

answer:  To determine how far Elvis is from his house now, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point:
- Distance^2 = (Distance west)^2 + (Distance east)^2
- Distance^2 = 90^2 + 144^2
- Distance^2 = 8100 + 20736
- Distance^2 = 28836

Take the square root of both sides to find the distance:
- Distance = √28836
- Distance ≈ 170 miles

Therefore, Elvis is approximately 170 miles from his house.

answer:  First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

For German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Total daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/German Shepherd = 15 kg/day.

For Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Total daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/Bulldog = 6 kg/day.

Now, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
- Total daily consumption = Daily consumption for German Shepherds + Daily consumption for Bulldogs
- Total daily consumption = 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

Next, let's calculate the total weekly consumption:
- Total weekly consumption = Total daily consumption * 7 days
- Total weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

1. Identify the number of blue blocks.
2. Calculate the number of yellow blocks.
3. Determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
4. Subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks.

1. The number of blue blocks is given as 4.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. The total number of blue and yellow blocks is the sum of the blue and yellow blocks:
   \[
   4 + 8 = 12
   \]
4. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
   \[
   32 - 12 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\).

answer:  To determine the force needed to move the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.

1. The weight of the car is 1200 pounds.
2. The weight of the luggage is 250 pounds.
3. Each of the two children weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(2 \times 75 = 150\) pounds.

Adding these together gives the total weight of the car and its contents:
\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:
\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any.
2. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas dropped from the total number of marbles he had to find out how many he has left.
3. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas has left from the total number of marbles Mazie had to find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

First, we know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. Therefore, the total number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any is:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles in total. Since Dallas received 25 marbles, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

answer:  First, calculate the depreciation for the first year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the first year} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \]
\[ \text{Value after the first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \]

Next, calculate the depreciation for the second year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the second year} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \]
\[ \text{Value after the second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \]

Finally, calculate the depreciation for the third year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the third year} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \]
\[ \text{Value after the third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528 \]

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

\[ \boxed{3528} \]

answer:  To determine the total cost Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights.
   - Each night costs $80.
   - Total cost for the hotel stay = 3 nights \times $80/night = $240.

2. **Cost of the bus trips:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - 10% of one night at the hotel = 0.10 \times $80 = $8.
   - Total cost for the bus trips = 7 trips \times $8/trip = $56.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the hotel stay + Cost of the bus trips
   - Total cost = $240 + $56 = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of one place setting. Each place setting consists of:
- 1 dinner plate at $6.00
- 1 salad plate at $4.00
- 1 bowl at $5.00

The cost of one place setting is:
\[ \$6.00 + \$4.00 + \$5.00 = \$15.00 \]

Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, so she needs 12 place settings. The total cost for 12 place settings is:
\[ 12 \times \$15.00 = \$180.00 \]

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

answer:  To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Given that Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

\[ \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Emma's age} = 40 + 16 \]
\[ \text{Emma's age} = 56 \]

Next, we calculate the average of their ages. The average is the sum of their ages divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{96}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 48 \]

So, the average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48.

answer:  To determine the total cost, we need to add the cost of the adult tickets, the cost of the child ticket, and the cost of the popcorns.

1. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 parents:
   \[
   \text{Cost of adult tickets} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

2. The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child:
   \[
   \text{Cost of child ticket} = 1 \times 8 = 8
   \]

3. The cost of a popcorn is $3, and they buy 2 popcorns:
   \[
   \text{Cost of popcorns} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

Now, we add these costs together:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of adult tickets} + \text{Cost of child ticket} + \text{Cost of popcorns} = 24 + 8 + 6 = 38
\]

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38.

answer:  To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2 \text{ per cupcake} = \$40 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling cookies:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, add the revenue from cupcakes and cookies to find the total revenue:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Then, calculate the total cost of the trays:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4 \text{ per tray} = \$20 \]

Finally, subtract the cost of the trays from the total revenue to find the remaining money:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

So, Frances has \$60 left.

\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all five pigs in a day:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all five pigs in a week:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, let's determine how much feed is left after a week. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so:

\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, after a week, Dexter will have 20 pounds of feed left.

answer:  To find the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny.
2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells.

First, let's find the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny:

- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells:

- They found 67 cracked seashells.

Good seashells = 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665.

answer:  First, let's determine the ages of the sisters:
- There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
- Total age of sisters = 3 sisters * 16 years/sister = 48 years.

Next, let's determine the ages of the brothers:
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- This younger brother is half the age of the older brother.
- Therefore, the older brother is 12 years * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- Total age of sisters = 48 years
- Total age of brothers = 12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 36 years

Total age of all siblings = 48 years + 36 years = 84 years.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs per guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, subtract the number of hot dogs John already has:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, determine how many packs of hot dogs are needed. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs per pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of children:**
   - There are 5 children following the truck at the end of the first street.

2. **On the second street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by one more child.
   - Therefore, the total number of children after the second street is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \).

3. **On the third street:**
   - Each of the 10 children from the second street is joined by 2 more children.
   - Therefore, the total number of children after the third street is \( 10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 \).

4. **The original 5 children leave:**
   - The original 5 children who were following the truck at the end of the first street give up and leave.
   - Therefore, the number of children remaining following the truck is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

So, the number of children now following the truck is 25.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we calculate:

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

\[ 11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Then, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Finally, add up all the fabric amounts to find the total amount of fabric for the quilt:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the quilt is 101 square feet in total.

\[ \boxed{101} \]

- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

Next, calculate the total value for each type of coin:
- James finds 1 quarter: \(1 \times 25 = 25\) cents.
- James finds 2 nickels: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.
- James finds 7 dimes: \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, add the values of all the coins together:

answer:  First, calculate the total time Charisma spends meditating in a day:
- She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed.
- Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

Next, calculate the total time Charisma spends practicing yoga in a week:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week.
- Total yoga time per week = 1 hour/day * 5 days/week = 5 hours/week = 5 * 60 minutes/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga in a week:
- Total meditation time per week = 30 minutes/week
- Total yoga time per week = 300 minutes/week
- Total time per week = 30 minutes/week + 300 minutes/week = 330 minutes/week

Finally, calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks:
- Total time = 330 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1320 minutes

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his chores over 3 weeks:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how much Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends, which is a total of 4 ice cream cones:

\[ 4 \text{ cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream cones:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ dollars}}{6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket}} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

answer:  To determine how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in one week.
2. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars.

First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in one week:
- The company produces 5000 bars per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in one week, the company produces \( 5000 \times 7 = 35000 \) bars.

Next, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks:
- In two weeks, the company produces \( 35000 \times 2 = 70000 \) bars.

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars:
- Each bar is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 70000 \times 2 = 140000 \).

answer:  First, calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we have:

\[ 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ seeds/dozen} = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 \text{ seeds} = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the number of seeds in a large sunflower is:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, add the number of seeds from both types of sunflowers to find the total number of seeds:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 54 \text{ seeds} = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]

answer:  To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Albert's height.
2. Determine Anne's height based on Albert's height.
3. Calculate Jackie's current height based on the information given.
4. Subtract the growth over the summer from Jackie's current height to find her height before the summer.

1. Albert's height is given as 36 inches.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is:
   \[
   2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is:
   \[
   72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before the summer was:
   \[
   70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{67}

- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for 2 people, so $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40, so we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

$40 - $27.00 = $13.00

Therefore, Janet has $13.00 left.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of each ingredient for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Next, calculate the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 jars * $44/jar = $440

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
- Total revenue for 10 jars = 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue for 10 jars - Total cost for 10 jars
- Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he only pays for one T-shirt at the full price and the other at 50% off.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16.

So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, the total amount Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $36.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.

Total amount spent by Ellen:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes at $100 each.

Total amount spent by Lani:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 100 = 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, they spent a total of $335.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
\[6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\]

Next, we need to determine how many holes are filled per day. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled per day is:
\[9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}\]

Now, let's find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes:
\[84 \text{ holes} \div 3 \text{ holes/day} = 28 \text{ days}\]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[28 \text{ days} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 4 \text{ weeks}\]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes dug by the dog.

The answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]

answer:  To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings for 2 weeks.

1. Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. Therefore, he is open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. That's 5 days in a week.

2. Josh services 3 cars each day. So, in a week, he services 5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars.

3. Josh gets paid $4 per car. Therefore, his weekly earnings are 15 cars * $4/car = $60.

4. To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

answer:  To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs needed for 4 tables.
2. Calculate the total number of screws required for all the legs.
3. Subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws James has.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs needed for 4 tables:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of screws required for all the legs:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

Finally, let's subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws James has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

answer:  Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

First, let's determine how many toy soldiers will be sold at each price:
- Half of 12 toy soldiers is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.
- Therefore, 6 toy soldiers will be sold at $5 per toy, and 6 toy soldiers will be sold at $7 per toy.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from each group:
- Earnings from the 6 toy soldiers sold at $5 per toy: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) dollars.
- Earnings from the 6 toy soldiers sold at $7 per toy: \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add the earnings from both groups to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: \( 30 + 42 = 72 \) dollars.

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $72.

\[
\boxed{72}

answer:  To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to the enrollment at Butler High School, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.

First, let's calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School:
\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} \]
\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]
\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = 3000 \]

Next, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:
\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]
\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

answer:  To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required based on the dock length.
2. Subtract the amount of line the caretaker has from the total amount required.

First, let's calculate the total amount of line required:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.

So, the total amount of line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line the caretaker has from the total amount required:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line required} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line.

answer:  To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then sum these amounts.

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
   \]
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts raised by all three girls:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} = 430 + 750 + 700 = 1880
\]

Therefore, the girls raised a total of $1880.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of items Igor actually gathered:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes}
   \]

2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested:
   \[
   14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes}
   \]

3. Igor gathered the correct number of beakers:
   \[
   7 \text{ beakers}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
\[
8 \text{ test tubes} + 16 \text{ Petri dishes} + 7 \text{ beakers} = 31 \text{ items}
\]

The total number of items placed on the lab bench was 29. Therefore, the number of beakers lost is:
\[
31 \text{ items gathered} - 29 \text{ items on bench} = 2 \text{ beakers lost}
\]

Thus, Igor lost 2 beakers.

answer:  To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:
- Ana spends 3 minutes to peel one orange.
- In 60 minutes, Ana can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes:
- Jane spends 4 minutes to peel one orange.
- In 60 minutes, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

#### 5

So, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

answer:  First, we need to determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we calculate the profit per watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price per watermelon:

\[ \text{Profit per watermelon} = 0.25 \times 1.60 = \$0.40 \]

Now, we find the selling price per watermelon by adding the profit to the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

answer:  To determine how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2}{16} \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Her speed is \( \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute.
   - Therefore, the time she took to run 4 miles is \( \frac{4}{\frac{1}{8}} = 32 \) minutes.

\boxed{32 minutes}

answer:  To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue per reservation.
2. Calculate the total revenue per night.
3. Calculate the total revenue per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue per reservation.**

Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- 1 bottle of wine at $5: \(1 \times 5 = 5\)

Total revenue per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\)

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue per night.**

The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.

Total revenue per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\)

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue per week.**

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so there are 2 nights in a week.

Total revenue per week: \(2 \times 90 = 180\)

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week.

\(\boxed{180}\)

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows.

Now, substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

answer:  To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, Ana can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges in an hour.

Next, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges in an hour.

Now, we calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\).

answer:  First, let's determine the current ages of James and Dora.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.
2. James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to determine John's current age. John had James when he was 19, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, let's determine the age of John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. If he is currently 5 years old, then in 3 years he will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

So, John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years.

\[ \text{Discount} = 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Next, subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Then, calculate the cost of the installation:
\[ \text{Installation cost} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Finally, add the discounted price of the radiator and the installation cost to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, Mark paid $230.

Next, determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas:

\[ 1 \text{ Henry} + 3 \text{ friends} = 4 \text{ people} \]

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
