answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James runs in one day:**
   - James runs 3 sprints each day.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Therefore, the distance he runs in one day is:
     \[
     3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance James runs in one week:**
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, the distance he runs in one week is:
     \[
     180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
     \]

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.

answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

So, the amount of white fiber is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue fiber)} + 1 \text{ (white fiber)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

answer:  To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends.
3. Calculate the number of eggs left to sell.
4. Multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to find the daily earnings.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she eats a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.
3. The number of eggs left to sell is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs eaten, which is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs per day.
4. Janet sells each egg for $2, so her daily earnings are the number of eggs sold multiplied by the price per egg, which is 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18 per day.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The answer is $18.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost Josh incurred for the house:
- Initial cost of the house: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000

Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Next, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs:
- The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
- Initial value of the house: $80,000
- Increase in value: 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

New value of the house = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = New value of the house - Total cost
- Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

answer:  To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Charleston has 80 sheep.
   - Toulouse has 160 sheep.
   - Total number of sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
   - Total number of sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(\boxed{260}\).

answer:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses and the cost of the next 8 glasses separately.

1. **Cost of the first 8 glasses:**
   - Each glass costs $5.
   - Total cost for the first 8 glasses = \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the next 8 glasses:**
   - Every second glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass.
   - Price of each second glass = \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for the next 8 glasses = \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 16 glasses:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first 8 glasses + Cost of the next 8 glasses
   - Total cost = \( 40 + 24 = 64 \) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses he wants to buy.

answer:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the restart to install updates:

40 minutes (first part) + 60 minutes (second part) + 20 minutes (restart) = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

answer:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for all chickens in a day.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day, and Wendi has 20 chickens. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed in a day is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we add up the amounts of feed already given in the morning and afternoon meals:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total amount needed to find out how much feed is required for the final meal:
\[ 60 \text{ cups (total)} - 40 \text{ cups (already given)} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

answer:  To find the total cost of Toula's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. Cost of the donuts:
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

2. Cost of the mini cupcakes:
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

3. Cost of the mini cheesecakes:
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

answer:  To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads: 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - Downloads: Three times the number of downloads in the first month
   - Downloads: \(3 \times 60 = 180\)

3. **Third Month:**
   - Downloads: Reduced by 30% from the second month
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\)
   - Subtract this from the second month's downloads: \(180 - 54 = 126\)

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - First Month: 60
   - Second Month: 180
   - Third Month: 126
   - Total: \(60 + 180 + 126 = 366\)

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366.

Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10 = $<<1.2*10=12>>12 per hour.

Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, so she worked 45 - 40 = <<45-40=5>>5 overtime hours.

Her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12 = $<<5*12=60>>60.

Therefore, her total earnings for this week are $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460.

answer:  To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covers during each segment of his trip and then sum these distances.

1. **Distance covered during the first 3 hours at 60 mph:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance covered during the next 0.5 hours at 30 mph:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

3. **Distance covered during the last 1 hour at 80 mph:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles

Now, we sum these distances:
- Total distance = Distance from segment 1 + Distance from segment 2 + Distance from segment 3
- Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 80 miles = 275 miles

Therefore, John is 275 miles from home at the end of his trip.

answer:  To determine the profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the future value of the jewelry and electronic gadgets after the expected price increase.

**Jewelry:**
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected increase: 2.5%
- Increase in value: $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
- Future value of jewelry: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

**Electronic Gadgets:**
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected increase: 1.2%
- Increase in value: $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
- Future value of electronic gadgets: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Comparing the future values:
- Future value of jewelry: $5,125
- Future value of electronic gadgets: $8,096

The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit at the end of the month.

Therefore, the profit at the end of the month is $8,096.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for the contemporary dance students:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:

Finally, we calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 16 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

answer:  Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she has \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners.
4. After selling at the orange house, she has \( \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners left.

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
\[ \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{6} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 6 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

answer:  To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to compare the initial cost of planting the tree to the annual revenue from selling lemons minus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree.

1. **Initial cost of planting the tree**: $90
2. **Annual revenue from selling lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual cost of watering and feeding the tree**: $3
4. **Net annual revenue**: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take for the net annual revenue to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net annual revenue:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial cost}}{\text{Net annual revenue}} \]

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} \]

\[ \text{Number of years} = 12 \]

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from the lemon tree.

**Answer**: 12 years

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in one week:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Then, we calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

answer:  First, calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a teacher:
Weekly earnings as a teacher = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week

Next, calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a coach:
Weekly earnings as a coach = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week

Now, calculate her annual earnings as a teacher:
Annual earnings as a teacher = $700/week * 50 weeks = $<<700*50=35000>>35,000

Then, calculate her annual earnings as a coach:
Annual earnings as a coach = $450/week * 50 weeks = $<<450*50=22500>>22,500

Finally, calculate her total annual salary:
Annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $<<35000+22500=57500>>57,500

answer:  First, calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.

Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Next, determine the remaining distance Marissa needs to hike:
- Total distance = 12 miles
- Distance already walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire hike. Therefore, the total time for the hike should be:
- Total time = Total distance / Average speed
- Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

Now, calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles:
- Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
- Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at 6 miles per hour to achieve her desired average speed of 4 miles per hour.

answer:  To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distance covered on the first day to the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward.
On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, each train covers 230 miles in the two days.

answer:  To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to calculate the DVDs sold to each group of customers and then sum them up.

1. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs:
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

Now, we sum up the DVDs sold to all the customers:
\[
3 \text{ DVDs} + 4 \text{ DVDs} + 0 \text{ DVDs} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

answer:  The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a period of 4 hours. 

So, the total amount of candle melted is:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

answer:  First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
\[ 10 \text{ liters} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
\[ 15 \text{ liters} \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, let's add the water from both drinks:
\[ 6.67 \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, you spilled one liter of the orange drink, so the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ 15.67 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 14.67 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is approximately 14.67 liters.

The answer is 14.67 liters.

answer:  To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Samantha's current age.
2. Determine Raymond's current age.
3. Calculate the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
4. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

1. Samantha is currently 31 years old.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is:
   \[
   31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son is:
   \[
   25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the age of Raymond's son from the current year:
   \[
   2023 - 2 = 2021
   \]

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2021}

answer:  To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cartons.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs. Each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Finally, calculate the total cost of the cartons. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

answer:  To find the original price of the book, we need to reverse the discount calculation. The discount is 25%, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book.

The price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{\frac{3}{4}} \]
\[ P = 19.50 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ P = 19.50 \times 1.3333 \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

answer:  Let's denote Darrell's current age as \( 7x \) and Allen's current age as \( 11x \). According to the problem, their total age now is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]
\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:

\[ \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109.

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- 4 apples at $1.50 each: \( 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \)

Adding these costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. Subtract the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid to find out how much she spent on pizza:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} \]

Perform the division:
\[ 17 \div 8.50 \approx 1.94 \]

Since Marie can only order whole boxes, she ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

answer:  To find the average guess, we need to calculate each guess and then find the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, so 20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240 jelly beans.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of friends:
240 jelly beans / 3 friends = 80 jelly beans.

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans.

answer:  To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Raymond's Jewels:**
   Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Aaron's Jewels:**
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Aaron's jewels: \( 20 + 5 = 25 \)

3. **Siobhan's Jewels:**
   Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Siobhan's jewels: \( 25 - 2 = 23 \)

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

Given:
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
- The total cost of the two pairs of heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
- The total cost of the heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find \( B \), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 99 + 5 = B \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

answer:  To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance from the start of the trip to the first stop.
2. Identify the distance from the start of the trip to the second stop.
3. Calculate the distance between the first and second stops.

Given:
- The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
- The first stop is 20 miles from the start.
- The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means it is 45 miles from the start.

Now, let's calculate the distance between the first and second stops:

\[ \text{Distance between first and second stops} = \text{Distance to second stop} - \text{Distance to first stop} \]

\[ \text{Distance between first and second stops} = 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance between first and second stops} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled **25 miles** between his first and second stops.

answer:  To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then sum them up.

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
2. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's calculate 25% of the points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

Now, add this to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes to find the points he scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Finally, add the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to find the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

answer:  To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide that by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- On the third day, he runs for half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these together, the total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

answer:  Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

answer:  To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.
2. Multiply the total daily time by the number of days in a week to get the total weekly time.

First, let's calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
- John takes care of 10 dogs.

So, the total daily time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total weekly time spent taking care of all the dogs:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total weekly time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

answer:  If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
If Dana spends one-third of the time running, she runs for 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.
If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she walks for 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours.
The distance she runs in 2 hours is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
The distance she walks in 4 hours is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.
Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

2. Subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of pie available:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 26.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, let's determine how much money John spent on video games:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he had to spend is:
\[ \$35 + \$5 = \$40 \]

Since John had 13 lego sets and sold each for $15, we need to determine how many lego sets he still has:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} - 8 \text{ lego sets} = 5 \text{ lego sets} \]

Therefore, John still has 5 lego sets.

\( \boxed{5} \)

answer:  To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Age of Suzy's iPhone:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Age of Ben's iPhone:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

answer:  First, let's determine how many calories are in one serving of chips. Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving contains:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

Each serving contains 250 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many more calories you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since each serving contains 250 calories, you can eat:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams per serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

answer:  To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she initially had in her purse from the total number used to find out how many she purchased.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work:
- She placed 1 Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.
- She had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

So, the total number of Post-it notes used is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she initially had in her purse from the total number used:
- She initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

So, the number of Post-it notes she purchased is:
\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]

answer:  To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.
3. Determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand when holding the gemstone.

1. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw it \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) feet.
3. The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin: \(1200 - 1000 = 200\) feet.

answer:  To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of supplies.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit.

1. **Total cost of supplies:**
   - Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (since 10 candles per pound and 20 candles require 2 pounds).
   - Each pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00.
   - Total cost of supplies = 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00.

2. **Total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00.

3. **Net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of supplies
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

answer:  John spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each, so he bought:
\[ \frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties} \]

He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties} \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[ 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the blue ties is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the red ties is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[ 200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week:
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total eggs per week = 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs/week.

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens per week = 1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen.
- Total revenue per week = 147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week.

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling his eggs.

answer:  On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, and each article takes 4 hours to write:
\[ 5 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \text{ articles} \]
\[ 2 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ articles} \]
\[ 4 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the total hours spent writing articles over the three days:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 44 \text{ hours} \]

answer:  First, convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

   - Add the number of kittens adopted from the shelter to the number of kittens born by the house cats:
     \[
     7 \text{ (adopted)} + 21 \text{ (Patchy)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie)} = 40 \text{ kittens}
     \]

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

answer:  To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ units} = 90 \text{ occupied units} \]

Finally, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ occupied units} = 30 \text{ unoccupied units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

answer:  First, calculate the total weight of the comic books:
\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/comic book} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:
\[ 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
\[ 7.5 \text{ pounds} \div \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound/toy} = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to remove the remaining weight.

answer:  To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries after adding the extra fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 25% fee on the initial bill.
2. Add the delivery fee.
3. Add the tip.

First, let's calculate the 25% fee on the initial bill of $40.00:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times \$40.00 = \$10.00 \]

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the initial bill:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total:
\[ \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after adding the extra fees is $57.00.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{57.00} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/tire = $480
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 (since no truck tires were repaired)
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between the two days:
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480
- Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

answer:  To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie visit and then divide the total amount of money he has by this cost.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost of one movie visit is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie visit:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

answer:  To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the empty truck and the driver:**
   - The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

2. **Determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:**
   - The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds.
   - Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit:
     \[
     5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   - Each box weighs 15 pounds.
   - Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:
     \[
     \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \text{ boxes}
     \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

answer:  To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate her pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years separately.

1. For the first 20 years:
   - Annual pension: $50,000 per year
   - Total pension for 20 years: $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

2. For the remaining 10 years:
   - Annual pension: 5% of $50,000 per year
   - Total pension for 10 years: $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000

3. Total pension for 30 years:
   - Total pension: $1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $25,000 / 10 = $2,500.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
- The first half of the year consists of 6 months.
- The streaming service charges $140 per month.
- Total cost for the first half = 6 months * $140/month = $840.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
- The second half of the year consists of 6 months.
- The streaming service charges 10% less for the second half.
- 10% of $140 is $140 * 0.10 = $14.
- Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126.
- Total cost for the second half = 6 months * $126/month = $756.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount paid by the end of the year:
- Total amount paid = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half
- Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596

answer:  To determine the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

1. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.
2. **Unripe oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. Since there are 25 oranges in total, 20% of 25 is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 25 = 5 \text{ unripe oranges}
   \]
3. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \text{ oranges}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[
25 \text{ oranges} - 8 \text{ oranges} = 17 \text{ good oranges}

     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
\]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is:
\[
595
\]

answer:  To determine the total amount Janet paid, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. The cost of the material: $500
2. The cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch: $800
3. The insurance cost: 10% of the total construction cost

First, let's calculate the total construction cost:
\[ \text{Total construction cost} = 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate the insurance cost:
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 500 + 800 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people sent by one school:

1. Each school has 2 teams (one for girls and one for boys).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team has 1 coach.

So, the total number of players per school is:
\[ 2 \text{ teams} \times 5 \text{ players/team} = 10 \text{ players} \]

And the total number of coaches per school is:
\[ 2 \text{ teams} \times 1 \text{ coach/team} = 2 \text{ coaches} \]

Therefore, the total number of people sent by one school is:
\[ 10 \text{ players} + 2 \text{ coaches} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all schools is:
\[ 4 \text{ schools} \times 12 \text{ people/school} = 48 \text{ people} \]

So, all of the schools have sent a total of 48 people.

answer:  To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we need to add the instructions from both recipes.

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.
2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) instructions.

Now, add the instructions from both recipes:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

answer:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of gas in the tank.
2. Determine the total distance Sophia has traveled since last filling her tank.
3. Divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of gas in the tank.

First, let's calculate the total amount of gas in the tank:
- The tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

Next, let's determine the total distance Sophia has traveled since last filling her tank:
- She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank.

Now, we divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of gas in the tank:
\[ \text{Distance per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total distance traveled}}{\text{Total amount of gas in the tank}} \]
\[ \text{Distance per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ gallons}} = 8.33 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

So, Sophia can drive 8.33 miles on a single tank of gas.

answer:  First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session:

- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
- Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week:
- Jim does this 3 times a week.

So, in one week, Jim spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes: \( 8 \text{ classes} \)

Total classes in a week: \( 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \)

Next, calculate the total number of students in a week:
- Each class has 15 students: \( 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \)

Finally, calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:
- She charges $15.00 per student: \( 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \)

So, Judy makes $7425 in one week.

answer:  To find the average square footage of a level, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

First, let's determine the square footage of each level:
- The top level has a square footage of 16.
- The second level has half the square footage of the top level, so it has \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square units.
- The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it has \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square units.
- The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square units.

Next, we sum up the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount.
The discount is 30% of the original price of $100.
\[ \text{Discount} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

\[ \text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

\[ \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \]

Now, we sum the revenues from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from brownies} + \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} \]

answer:  To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones.
2. Calculate the interest for each cell phone.
3. Determine the total amount to be paid including interest.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. The total cost of the five cell phones is:
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. The interest for each cell phone is:
   \[
   150 \times 0.02 = 3
   \]

3. The total amount to be paid including interest is:
   \[
   5 \times (150 + 3) = 765
   \]

4. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
   \[
   \frac{765}{3} = 255
   \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month.

answer:  To determine the total number of thorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns.

First, let's find the total number of roses:
- Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
- Each rose bush has 25 roses.

So, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of thorns:
- Each rose has 8 thorns.

So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

answer:  To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and in packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3.
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2.
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

Now, let's compare the two costs:
- Cost in packages of 3: $15
- Cost in packages of 2: $9

Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find the total amount of dog food needed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to cover 550 cups:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. #### 5

1. Determine how much laundry David does.
2. Determine how much laundry Raymond does.
3. Calculate the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Given:
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

First, find out how much laundry David does:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, find out how much laundry Raymond does:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \( 100 \) pounds.

answer:  To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
3. Add Grace's and Alex's weights together.

1. Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds.
2. Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed 623

answer:  To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate her initial annual salary.
2. Determine the annual increase in salary.
3. Calculate the total increase over three years.
4. Add the total increase to her initial salary to find her new salary.

1. **Initial Annual Salary:**
   - Monthly salary: $600
   - Annual salary: $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200

2. **Annual Increase in Salary:**
   - Annual increase = 10% of $7200
   - Annual increase = 0.10 * $7200 = $720

3. **Total Increase Over Three Years:**
   - Total increase = $720/year * 3 years = $2160

4. **New Annual Salary:**
   - New salary = Initial salary + Total increase
   - New salary = $7200 + $2160 = $9360

After three more years, Sylvie's annual salary will be $9360.

answer:  First, let's determine how much water each girl received. Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water:

\[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water given to the girls is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy received 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy is:

\[ \text{Total water given} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water given from the initial amount of water:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total number of liters of water left is 10 liters.

\[ \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many pets Jan has. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia:

\[ \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we sum up the number of pets each person has to find the total:

\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is 28.

answer:  To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each occurrence and then sum them up.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang for 4 times, the second time it rang for \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang for 12 times, the third time it rang for \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we add up the number of rings from each occurrence:
- First time: 4 rings
- Second time: 12 rings
- Third time: 6 rings

Total rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

answer:  To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacations he has been on.
3. Calculate the total number of quilt blocks.

First, let's find out how many years Gene has been vacationing:
- Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
- He is currently 34 years old.
- Number of years he has been vacationing = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Next, let's calculate the number of vacations he has been on:
- Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.
- Total number of vacations = Number of years * Number of vacations per year. 
- Total number of vacations = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each vacation results in one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations:
- Total number of quilt blocks = Total number of vacations = 44.

Therefore, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.

answer:  Let's denote the number of games the football team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the football team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 students.

Given:
- Total number of students = 200
- Fraction of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \)

Number of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \)

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the Girl Scouts.

Given:
- Fraction of girls in the Girl Scouts = \( \frac{2}{3} \)

Number of girls in the Girl Scouts = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \)

Finally, we calculate the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts.

Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts = Number of girls - Number of girls in the Girl Scouts
Number of girls not in the Girl Scouts = 120 - 80 = 40

Therefore, the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts is 40.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- Total potato salad for adults = 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Next, calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
- There are 5 children.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Finally, add the total potato salad needed for both adults and children:
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

answer:  Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald's record as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

Solve for \( H \) by dividing both sides by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many guests will actually show up. Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't show up.

\[ \text{Number of guests who don't show up} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who will show up is:

\[ \text{Number of guests who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest.

\[ \text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

\[ \boxed{18} \]

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]

answer:  To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

1. **Number of dogs:**
   Given that the number of dogs is 60.

2. **Number of cats:**
   There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. **Total number of pets:**
   Adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits gives:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

1. **James's Age:**
   - James is 10 years old.

2. **Corey's Age:**
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) years old.

3. **Amy's Age:**
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Amy's age is \( 11 - 2 = 9 \) years old.

4. **Jackson's Age:**
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Therefore, Jackson's age is \( 9 - 5 = 4 \) years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

First, we find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Next, we calculate the total time required to cover these 14 segments:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

answer:  Let's denote Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds.

According to the problem,
- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is 40 seconds.

Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 0.10 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After \( x \) cars drive through in the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( 30 - x \).

Then, 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway becomes \( 30 - x + 20 = 50 - x \).

Finally, 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway becomes \( 50 - x - 5 = 45 - x \).

We know that after these events, there are still 30 cars on the motorway. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45 - x = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 45 - 30 = x \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

answer:  To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many hours James slept.
2. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

First, let's calculate how many hours James slept:

James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. Harry slept 9 hours.

\[ \text{Harry's sleep} = 9 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]
\[ \text{James's sleep} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we need to convert 1.5 hours into minutes:
\[ 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find out how many episodes he watched:
\[ \frac{90}{30} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

answer:  To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking.
2. Determine how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Calculate the total number of tomatoes used.

First, we know that when Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce:

\[ \text{Volume of tomatoes before cooking} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Finally, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

answer:  To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]
4. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, we sum up all the rings:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \text{ times}
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings the doorbell made is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]

answer:  To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption for weekdays and weekends.

### Weekdays:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, each weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

### Weekends:
- On weekends, John does not drink any water because he has a soda with dinner instead.

So, each weekend, John drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses of water} \]

### Total Weekly Consumption:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- There are 2 weekends in a week.

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 5 \times 4 + 2 \times 0 = 20 \text{ glasses of water} \]

#### John drinks 20 glasses of water in a week.

answer:  To determine the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read and then divide that by the number of days he has left.

First, let's find the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Next, we subtract the number of pages he has already read:
- Pages read on Monday: 15 pages

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day to complete his reading on time.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rowed in 64 seconds.

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{20 \times 64}{16} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

answer:  To find the inner dimensions of each box, we need to subtract 2 inches from each side of the outer dimensions (since the walls are 1 inch thick on each side).

Outer dimensions of each box:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

Inner dimensions of each box:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
- Inner volume of one box = Length × Width × Height
- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches
- Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
- Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3
- Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to make \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
- Total cost = 10 * $10 = $100.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
- Total cost = 5 * $16 = $80.

Now, let's find the total cost of all the boards:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the price of lumber has increased by 50%, the new price for each board is:
- New price per board = $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Total revenue = 15 * $15 = $225.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = $225 - $180 = $45.

answer:  To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate.

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long:
\[ 2 \text{ roll-ups} \times 24 \text{ roll-ups} = 48 \text{ roll-ups} \]

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long:
\[ 3 \text{ roll-ups} \times 14 \text{ roll-ups} = 42 \text{ roll-ups} \]

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 \text{ roll-ups} + 42 \text{ roll-ups} = 90 \text{ roll-ups} \]

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ roll-ups}}{2 \text{ people}} = 45 \text{ roll-ups} \]

So, they ate an average of 45 roll-ups.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the gas without cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback amount.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas without cashback:
- The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
- The customer buys 10 gallons.
- Total cost without cashback = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cashback amount:
- The app company offers $0.20 per gallon.
- The customer buys 10 gallons.
- Total cashback = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:
- Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00.

answer:  To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the total number of lessons per day and the number of cleans per lesson.

1. Calculate the total number of lessons per day:
   - There are 4 teachers.
   - Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of lessons per day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day}
     \]

2. Calculate the number of cleans per lesson:
   - The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

3. Calculate the total number of cleans per day:
   - There are 8 lessons per day.
   - Each lesson has 3 cleans.
   - Therefore, the total number of cleans per day is:
     \[
     8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleans per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleans per day}
     \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

answer:  Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write:
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30000 \]

So, Lylah earned $30,000 four years ago.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Lylah's salary remains the same at $30,000.

Therefore, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 30000 = 86000 \]

The answer is $86000.

answer:  To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the capacity of Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 50D = 300 \).
   - Solving for \( D \):
     \[
     D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

Thus, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.

answer:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, for a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Kael brought 10 apples and 4 oranges, for a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits in total.

answer:  To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

The total number of parts is the sum of the ratio parts:
\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, which means the total number of parts is 120. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of parts by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts, we calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by the number of parts for sugar:
\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:
\[
\boxed{42}

answer:  To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and the remaining time at 5 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours:
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. Add the distances from both segments to find the total distance:
   - Distance in the first 3 hours: 30 miles
   - Distance in the remaining 4 hours: 20 miles
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

answer:  To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day.
2. Determine the total number of vehicles on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, let's calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day:
- There are 2 containers.
- Each container contains 5 vehicles.
- Total vehicles on the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.

Next, we know the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles on the second day is:
- Total vehicles on the second day = Total vehicles on the second day - Total vehicles on the first day = 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
- Number of containers imported on the second day = Total vehicles on the second day / Vehicles per container = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.

answer:  To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
2. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month.

First, let's find the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week:
- Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.
- There are 30 sheets of paper in each pad.

So, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- He uses 60 sheets per week.

So, the number of sheets he uses per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep pattern day by day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \(5 + 1 = 6\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than Friday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:

\[ 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 36 \]

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 36 hours throughout the week.

answer:  Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

1. Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

answer:  To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Therefore, the total number of sausages is:
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, his expenditure in June is:

\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June:

\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940.

answer:  To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamps:**
   Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after stamping:**
   We know that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

3. **Calculate the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began:**
   Since Jennie stamped 20 letters and there are now 30 letters in the pile, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began is:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters in the pile when Jennie began} = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was 10.

answer:  The hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
The total number of hours spent with patients each day is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.
The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from patients is 200 * $200 = $40,000.
The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital, so the total cost for the doctors is 200 * $150 = $30,000.
The profit for the hospital is the difference between the revenue and the cost, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

answer:  First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5.

Brian initially has 20 video games and loses 5:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, Brian has 15 video games.

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.

Calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:
\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

1. Calculate the miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles for all three days to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the miles Walt walked on Tuesday:
- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
- Therefore, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.

Next, let's determine the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday:
- Total miles on Monday and Tuesday: \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles.

Finally, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles for all three days to find the miles walked on Wednesday:
- Total miles for all three days: 41 miles.
- Miles walked on Wednesday: \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

answer:  To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of car washes Tom gets in a year.
2. Calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year.

First, let's find out how many car washes Tom gets in a year:
- Tom gets 4 car washes a month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of car washes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the car washes in a year:
- Each car wash costs $15.
- Tom gets 48 car washes in a year.

So, the total cost in a year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

answer:  To determine the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the given information and setting up an equation.

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs.
2. Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.
3. According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   P = 4B + 22
   \]
4. We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).
5. Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
   \[
   P = 4(12) + 22
   \]
6. Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   P = 48 + 22
   \]
7. Add the results:
   \[
   P = 70
   \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets.

Total tickets for roller coaster rides = 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the luge rides:

- Pam rode the luge 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.
- Fred rode the luge 2 times, so he used 2 * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.

Total tickets for luge rides = 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.

Finally, let's add the tickets used for the roller coaster rides and the luge rides to find the total number of tickets used:

Total tickets used = 36 tickets + 24 tickets = 60 tickets.

The answer is 60 tickets.

answer:  Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each, so the cost for the subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.
She also orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, so the cost for the chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
And she orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so the cost for the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.
There is a 20% delivery fee added at checkout, so the delivery fee is 20% * $20.00 = $4.00.
She also wants to add a $5.00 tip.
The total cost of the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.
Therefore, Rory's delivery order will cost $29.00.

answer:  Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

The first test had 75 questions, so he left:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Mark completed the second test at a rate of 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

The second test had 100 questions, so he left:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of all the items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, calculate the tax amount:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = $15 * 0.10 = $1.50

Finally, add the tax to the total cost before tax:

Total cost including tax = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

So, the total cost of everything, including tax, is $16.50.

answer:  To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
2. Determine the number of female Scottish unicorns.

First, let's find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands:
\[ \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 \]
\[ \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{27}{3} \]
\[ \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns:
\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6.

\[ \boxed{6} \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of queen bees as \( Q \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).

There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know the total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now that we know there are 100 queen bees, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ \text{Number of worker bees} = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

- Number of automatic cars: 12
- Number of manual cars: 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic cars - Number of manual cars
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Next, calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

answer:  First, let's determine the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours:
\[ 30 \text{ bees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of bees that returned in the next 6 hours:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees} \]

Then, we calculate the number of bees that flew out from the hive in the next 6 hours:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees} \]

Now, let's find the total number of bees that left the hive in the first 12 hours:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 \text{ bees} \]

Since every bee that left before returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is equal to the total number of bees that left the hive:
\[ 105 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, Debra saw 105 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

answer:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples in John's field.
2. Determine how many harvests John can perform in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples:
- John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

So, the total number of pineapples is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples per hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many harvests John can perform in a year:
- John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months per harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of Lego blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each Lego set and then sum them up.

1. The first Lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second Lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. Therefore, the number of pieces in the second Lego set is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. The third Lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set. Therefore, the number of pieces in the third Lego set is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125
   \]

Now, we sum the number of pieces from all three Lego sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego blocks.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:
- Bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires per person = 10 tires
- Tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires per person = 9 tires
- Unicycles: 1 person * 1 tire per person = 1 tire

Next, add the total number of tires inflated:
- Total tires = 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires

Now, calculate the total revenue from inflating the tires:
- Cost per tire = 25 cents = $0.25
- Total revenue = 20 tires * $0.25 per tire = $5

Therefore, Shawnda made $5 that day.

answer:  To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many friends Dorothy has.
2. Use the number of friends Dorothy has to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 12 \]

To find the number of friends Dorothy has, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has by multiplying the number of Dorothy's friends by 4:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

\[ \boxed{16} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, let's calculate the cost of supplies for each client:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2.
- Each pack of cloths costs $5.
- Total cost per client = (2 bottles * $2/bottle) + (1 pack * $5/pack) = $4 + $5 = $9 per client.

Now, let's calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Total expenses = 8 clients * $9 per client = $72.

Next, let's calculate Kim's total income each week:
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 in profit each week.

answer:  First, convert the distance each person needs to travel to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, calculate the time it takes for each person to travel their respective distances:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, find the difference in time between the two:
- Difference in time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner (Steve) will be waiting 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 2 feet = 2 * 12 = 120 inches)

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods:

Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 120 inches = 2040 inches

Next, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we divide the total length by 12:

Total length in feet = 2040 inches / 12 inches/foot = 170 feet

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods is 170 feet.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day, so he spends a total of 2 classes/day * 2 hours/class = 4 hours on these days.
In one week, Kimo spends a total of 3 hours + 4 hours = 7 hours attending classes.
In one semester, there are 16 weeks, so Kimo spends a total of 7 hours/week * 16 weeks = 112 hours attending classes.

2. Calculate the cost of one adult ticket.
3. Add the cost of one child ticket and one adult ticket to find the total cost.
4. Add the change received to the total cost to find the amount given.

1. The cost of one child ticket is $10.
2. The cost of one adult ticket is $12.
3. The total cost for one child ticket and one adult ticket is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of child ticket} + \text{Cost of adult ticket} = 10 + 12 = 22
   \]
4. Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount she gave the cashier is:
   \[
   \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} = 22 + 8 = 30

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 14 - 7 - 9) = \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) = x - 30 \) fries.
5. Ants carried off one more fry, leaving \( x - 30 - 1 = x - 31 \) fries.
6. We are told that there were 5 fries left, so \( x - 31 = 5 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 5 + 31 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

Therefore, there were initially 36 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

answer:  To determine how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays to find the change.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies:
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies.
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
Each cookie costs $0.10.
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays to find the change:
Carl pays with a $10 bill, so he pays $10.00.
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, Carl receives $4 in change.

answer:  To determine how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of each item he bought and then sum them up.

1. **Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Rim of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The rim of bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for rim of bond paper = 1 rim * $20/rim = $20.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of rim of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

answer:  Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. The distance for one round trip is 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards. Therefore, Blake runs a total of 200 yards * 15 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 40 yards * 2 = 80 yards. Therefore, Kelly runs a total of 80 yards * 34 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly runs a total of 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:

3000 yards (Blake) - 2920 yards (Kelly) = 80 yards.

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 80 yards farther than Kelly.

   - Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
   - Total cost = \( 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $50.

answer:  To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes in one month.

Monkeys: 200 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas

Total bananas per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for 2 months.

Total bananas for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

answer:  To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and then apply that increase to the original price.

1. **Calculate the price increase every two months:**
   - The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the price after every two-month period is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the price after 36 months:**
   - There are 18 two-month periods in 36 months (since 36 divided by 2 = 18).
   - After each two-month period, the price is $24.
   - Therefore, after 18 two-month periods, the price is \( 24 \times 18 = 432 \) dollars.

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $432.

answer:  Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

answer:  To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish they caught and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5

Now, let's sum up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
- Total fish caught by Anakin: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19
- Total fish caught by Locsin: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13

Finally, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
- Total fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

answer:  To determine the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the depth of the water on Monday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the depth on Monday.
3. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday by finding two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

answer:  To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. Spiders:
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders = 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

2. Insects:
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects = 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

3. Rare mutant invertebrates:
   - Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
640 (spiders) + 540 (insects) + 30 (rare mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs.

answer:  To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 Spanish flans.
2. Determine how many eggs Sandra gets from her neighbor each time she babysits.
3. Calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get the required number of eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs needed:
- Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs.
- Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans.
- Total eggs needed = 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs.

Next, let's determine how many eggs Sandra gets from her neighbor each time she babysits:
- Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits.

Now, let's calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs:
- Number of babysits = Total eggs needed / Eggs per babysit
- Number of babysits = 45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysit = 5 babysits.

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times.

answer:  To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.
2. Subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the computer and accessories:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Next, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
- Budget: €1500
- Total cost: €1423

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1423

Money left for clothing = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The answer is €77.

answer:  To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   - The hat costs $25.

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jacket is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   - The average cost of the hat and the jacket is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
   - Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
   - Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Therefore, each uniform costs $150 in total.

answer:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the lost income from doing taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the lost income from doing taxes herself:
- Jackie earns $35 per hour for freelance work.
- She will miss 3 hours of work if she does the taxes herself.
- Therefore, the lost income is:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's consider the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, let's compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The lost income is $105.
- The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.
- The difference is:
  \[
  105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50 \text{ per glass} = \$10 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Since they made a profit of $25, the total revenue must be:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue per gallon} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$10 + \$25 = \$35 \]

Now, calculate the total cost of lemons:
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = \$35 - \$5 = \$30 \]

Therefore, they spent $30 on lemons.

   - Total miles = Miles walked on weekdays + Miles walked on weekends
   - Total miles = \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

So, Pancho walks \( 120 \) miles in a week.

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd tutored 5 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are:
  \[
  5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the second week:
- Lloyd tutored 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are:
  \[
  8 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum up his earnings for both weeks:
\[
50 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Lloyd earned \( \boxed{130} \) for the first two weeks.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Billy to prepare the potatoes, we need to calculate the time spent peeling and cutting each potato and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling one potato:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- 1.5 minutes is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting one potato:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, let's find the total time for one potato:
- Total time for one potato = Time to peel + Time to cut
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds.

Finally, let's calculate the total time for all 60 potatoes:
- Total time = Total time for one potato * Number of potatoes
- Total time = 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds.

Convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- Total time = 5700 seconds / 60 seconds = 95 minutes.

#### 95 minutes.

answer:  First, calculate the increased monthly payment for each debt by adding 50% to the minimum payment:

- Student loans: $300/month + 50% of $300/month = $300/month + $150/month = $450/month
- Credit card: $200/month + 50% of $200/month = $200/month + $100/month = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500/month + 50% of $500/month = $500/month + $250/month = $750/month

Next, sum the increased monthly payments for all debts to find the total increased monthly payment:

$450/month + $300/month + $750/month = $1500/month

Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the annual payment:

$1500/month * 12 months/year = $18000/year

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

answer:  To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the age of each bird and then sum them up.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age:**
   - Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

2. **Sally Four's age:**
   - Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is 8 years old.

3. **Granny Red's age:**
   - Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.

4. **Sally Two's age:**
   - Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years

So, the total age is 51 years.

answer:  To find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.

1. **Bo's crabs:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's crabs:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Rani's crabs:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of crabs each person has:
\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs}
\]
\[
\text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[

answer:  To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the race and then find the difference.

**Team 1:**
- Each runner runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 runners.
- Total time for Team 1 = 55 seconds/runner * 4 runners = 220 seconds.

**Team 2:**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs their leg in 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs their leg in 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs their leg in 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds.
- Total time for Team 2 = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

**Difference in time:**
- Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win the race by 2 seconds.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.
After spending on rent and car fuel, Zaid is left with $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500.
He donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.
After donating to the charity, Zaid is left with $2500 - $1250 = $1250.
He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so he gives away a total of $200 + $700 = $900.
After giving away $900, Zaid is left with $1250 - $900 = $350.
Therefore, Zaid will still have $350 after all these expenses and donations.

answer:  To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Chinese people.
2. Subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people to find the number of girls.

First, let's find the total number of Chinese people:
\[ \text{Total number of Chinese people} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese people} \]
\[ \text{Total number of Chinese people} = 240 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Total number of Chinese people} = 160 \]

Next, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people to find the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Total number of Chinese people} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

\boxed{100}

answer:  To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total interest and add it to the principal amount.

First, let's calculate the monthly interest:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = 2 \]

Next, let's calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Monthly Interest} \times \text{Number of Months} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 2 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 6 \]

Finally, let's add the total interest to the principal amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 106 \]

Mandy should give Benedict $106.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jan's current age:**
   - Jan is 30 years old.

2. **Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years old.

3. **Mark's current age:**
   - Since two years ago, Mark was 20 years old, his current age is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) years old.

4. **Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jean is 24 years old.

answer:  To determine the number of votes the loser received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes the winner received.
2. Subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

First, let's calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Next, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 20
\]

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

answer:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 5W = 200 \).
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

2. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, \( R = 4W \).
   - Substituting \( W = 40 \):
     \[
     R = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business with him.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters and rabbits:

- Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
- Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces of straw

Next, let's find out how many pieces of straw are left for the rats:

- Total straw distributed: 160 pieces
- Straw for hamsters and rabbits: 70 pieces

Straw for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces of straw

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is:

- Total rats = 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 15 rats

The rats are kept in 3 cages, so the number of rats in each cage is:

- Rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

1. Identify the number of apples Jenna's mom picked.
2. Calculate the number of apples Jenna picked based on the information given.
3. Add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total.

Given:
- Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.
- Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

First, calculate the number of apples Jenna picked:
\[ \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples her mom picked} \]
\[ \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Next, add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mom picked} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

They both picked 30 apples.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, let's find the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
  \[
  10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
  \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- To find the daily requirement, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
  \[
  35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
  \]

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

answer:  First, calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{3}{6} \times \frac{3}{6} = \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, find the difference in probability:
\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

answer:  To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.

The cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$1.50 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the 8 pens will cost $12.00.

answer:  To determine how much each friend paid, we first need to calculate the total amount spent by the three friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25
2. **Cost of food**: $4.50 less than the cost of tickets, so:
   \[
   20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]
3. **Cost of rides**: There are 2 rides, and each ride costs $33, so:
   \[
   2 \times 33 = 66
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount spent:
\[
20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 107.00
\]

Since the three friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
\[
\frac{107.00}{3} = 35.67
\]

Therefore, each friend paid $35.67.

answer:  Let's denote the number of bags of wheat sold as \( n \).

The trader buys each bag for $20 and spends $2 on transport per bag, so the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. The profit is calculated as the revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30n - 22n \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 400 = 30n - 22n \]
\[ 400 = 8n \]

Solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

answer:  To determine how much change Violetta will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons:
- Violetta needs 5 different colors of crayons.
- Each crayon costs $2.

Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 crayons × $2 per crayon
Total cost = $10

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:
- Violetta has $20.

Change = Amount of money - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Therefore, Violetta will get $10 in change.

answer:  First, determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences per publisher} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from each publisher:

- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence:
  \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays:
  \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

answer:  Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

After the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
So, after the first month, she had 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
So, after the second month, she had 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
So, after the third month, she had 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add up all the cards she has collected:
\[ 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \]

Therefore, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards in total.

answer:  To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom gains each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years.
3. Subtract the number of trees that die.

First, let's calculate the net number of trees Tom gains each year:
- Tom plants 10 trees each year.
- Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
- Net gain per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Next, let's determine the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years:
- Tom starts with 50 trees.
- After 10 years, he has 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Finally, let's subtract the number of trees that die:
- 30% of the trees die.
- Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.30 = 39 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left.

answer:  To determine how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the pinkos and painted them white.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - Therefore, 6 pink flamingos were painted white.
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
3. On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

Now, we calculate the difference between the number of pink flamingos and the number of white flamingos:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos in the yard than white plastic flamingos.

answer:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

First, let's calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year:
- Josie has 10 acres of land.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.

So, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we convert the total tons of grapes into barrels of wine:
- Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}

answer:  To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add up the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches = 7 sandwiches * 2 slices/sandwich = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices.
   - Total slices for omelets = 3 omelets * 3 slices/omelet = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese Dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, we add up all the slices used:
Total slices = 14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni) = 31 slices.

answer:  Let's denote the weight of each candied apple as \( A \) grams.

Given that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2A = 40 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, each candied apple weighs 20 grams.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs \boxed{2600} grams.

1. **First four weeks:**
   - Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week.
   - He rode 25 kilometers each time.
   - Total distance in the first four weeks = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers.

2. **Next three weeks:**
   - Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week.
   - He rode 60 kilometers each time.
   - Total distance in the next three weeks = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

3. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance in the first four weeks + Distance in the next three weeks
   - Total distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 kilometers.

Therefore, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers.

answer:  To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water each pail contains.

First, let's find the total number of pails Baldur gets in a day:
- He gets 5 pails in the morning.
- He gets 6 pails in the afternoon.

So, the total number of pails in a day is:
\[ 5 \text{ pails} + 6 \text{ pails} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water per day is:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

answer:  Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens. According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \), and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

The total number of eggs collected every day is given as 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

answer:  Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she initially had:
\[ 22 + 10 = 32 \text{ pens} \]

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

The total number of blue and red pens she bought is:
\[ 54 + 12 = 66 \text{ pens} \]

Adding these to her initial number of pens:
\[ 32 + 66 = 98 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, Janet now has 98 pens.

answer:  Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and two pairs of shoes for $20 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs an additional:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

After babysitting, she has:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

She still needs:
\[ 60 - 30 = 30 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $30, we divide $30 by $4:
\[ \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 7.5 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

answer:  To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score Brinley has from the first five tests.
2. Determine the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests.
3. Subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score needed to find the score required on the sixth test.

First, let's calculate the total score from the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Next, let's determine the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score needed to find the score required on the sixth test:
\[ 558 - 438 = 120 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 120 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

answer:  To find the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Wednesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought each day:
\[
\text{Total cakes} = \text{Cakes on Monday} + \text{Cakes on Tuesday} + \text{Cakes on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total cakes} = 4 + 12 + 60
\]
\[
\text{Total cakes} = 76
\]

Therefore, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes over the three days.

answer:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of both items.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.5 \]

Since Lori cannot work a fraction of an hour, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need to work:
\[ 45 \text{ hours} \]

So, Lori will have to work 45 hours before she can afford the shoes and the belt.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2x \) gallons.

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the small pool now is \( x - 4 \times 4 = x - 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is \( 2x - 4 \times 4 = 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 4x - 2x = 64 - 16 \]
\[ 2x = 48 \]

So, the small pool has \( 24 \) gallons of water.

answer:  To find the total cost of buying each cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Subtract $1200 from the total cost of half a dozen plates to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 24 to find the cost per cup.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, subtract $1200 from the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Total cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Finally, divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 24 to find the cost per cup:
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{24} = 1450 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $1450

answer:  First, let's determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Therefore, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

- Naomi's points: 68
- Yuri's points: 44
- Brianna's points: 85

Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo are:

\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

answer:  To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide that by his walking speed.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 1.5 miles
- Width = 6 miles

So, the perimeter is:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( T \) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]
\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

answer:  First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

1. Harriet is currently 21 years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is \( 3 \times 21 = 63 \) years old.
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \) years old.

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:

- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \) years
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \) years
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \) years

Now, we calculate the average age in three years:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45.

answer:  To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
2. Determine the total number of customers over the first two days.
3. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day.

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \( 100 + 50 = 150 \).
3. The total number of customers over the first two days is \( 100 + 150 = 250 \).
4. The total number of customers by the third day is 500. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is \( 500 - 250 = 250 \).

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \( \boxed{250} \).

answer:  To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias and then add it to the number of geraniums.

Given:
- Andy plants 90 geraniums.
- He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

First, calculate the number of petunias:
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of petunias} = 50 \]

Next, add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 140 \]

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.

answer:  To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in each year and then sum them up.

1. The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.
2. The company spends a third of that amount in the second year.

First, calculate the amount spent in the second year:
\[ \text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 \]
\[ \text{Amount spent in the second year} = 5000 \]

Now, add the amounts spent in both years to find the total:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Amount spent in the first year} + \text{Amount spent in the second year} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

answer:  Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. Therefore, the additional amount she needs to return is:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to return is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. Therefore, the total amount she will pay in 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

The remaining balance after 12 months will be:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

answer:  To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses to the number of dahlias.

Number of roses = 4
Number of dahlias = 7 more than the number of roses = 4 + 7 = 11

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias = 4 + 11 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total.

answer:  To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles = 3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- Total time spent on sudoku puzzles = 8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles = 30 minutes.
- Total time spent on sudoku puzzles = 40 minutes.
- Total time spent playing these games = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of Chad's order:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

So, the total cost of Chad's order is $14.00.

Next, we subtract the value of the gift card:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cards James has initially:
- Fire type cards: 30
- Grass type cards: 20
- Water type cards: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes in the number of cards:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Total cards after changes = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Now, we calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
- Number of water type cards: 32
- Total number of cards: 96

Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100
Percentage chance ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

answer:  To determine how many liters of water are in the tank now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.
2. Determine the amount of rainwater Celine collected.
3. Add the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

First, let's calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters:
\[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of rainwater Celine collected. The rainwater is twice as much as the water left in the tank:
\[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, let's add the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:
\[ 30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]

\[ \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = \text{Robert's shells} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. According to the problem, Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday.

\[ \text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

Next, calculate the total tax on the cars:
10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Then, calculate the total registration cost for all cars:
12 cars * $1,000/car = $12,000

Finally, add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration cost to find the total amount Mark pays:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, Mark pays $276,000 for everything.

answer:  To determine the total cost for Carlos and Benji's boat rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Total cost for Carlos = $30/hour * 3 hours = $90.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Total cost for Benji = $18/hour * 5 hours = $90.

Now, we add the costs for both Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:
- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180.

Therefore, they will pay $180 for their rentals altogether.

answer:  To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **Travel from New Jersey to Rochester:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel from Rochester to New Jersey:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, it takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days to travel by car.

Now, let's add up the total travel time:
- Time from New Jersey to Rochester: 6 days
- Time from Rochester to New Jersey: 3 days

Total travel time = 6 days + 3 days = 9 days

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days.

2. Determine how many pizzas are required to provide that number of slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices needed:
- There are 20 friends.
- Each friend will have 4 slices.

\[ \text{Total slices needed} = 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to provide 80 slices:
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

\[ \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

answer:  To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve needs by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines.

answer:  First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place the puzzle pieces.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so her mom can add \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can add:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces per minute} + 2 \text{ pieces per minute} = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The answer is 1 hour.

answer:  First, calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

Next, determine the number of watermelons remaining after two months:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons were remaining after two months.

Now, calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest two weeks later:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later.

Finally, determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

answer:  To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa and then add them together.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Now, we add the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68
\]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is \boxed{68} years.

answer:  To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of ants and the number of bugs.

Given:
- Number of ants = 50
- Number of bugs = half the number of ants

First, calculate the number of bugs:
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{\text{Number of ants}}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, calculate the total number of insects:
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean.
2. Calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner.
3. Subtract the number of penguins that jump in and go inside the cave from the total number of penguins.

First, calculate the number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[ \text{Number of penguins that jump in} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Next, calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[ \text{Number of penguins that go inside the cave} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Now, subtract the number of penguins that jump in and go inside the cave from the total number of penguins:
\[ \text{Number of penguins still sunbathing} = 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for daily calls with his boss in a month. Since he has a 15-minute call every day and the month has 30 days, we calculate:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he has used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly phone plan to find out how many minutes he has left:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left.

answer:  First, determine the number of penpals Mike still has after he stopped being penpals with 2 of them:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, calculate the total number of pages Mike receives per week from his remaining penpals. Each penpal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long:
\[ 3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he writes the same number of pages each week:
\[ 30 \text{ pages} \]

Now, calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week. He writes 1 page every 6 minutes:
\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing each week.

\[ \boxed{3} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider both the pens he initially buys and the new pens he can create by using the ink from his empty pens.

1. **Initial Pens:**
   Ram initially buys 25 pens.

2. **New Pens from Empty Pens:**
   Ram can use the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. Therefore, for every 5 empty pens, he can create 1 new pen.

   Let's calculate how many new pens he can create from 25 pens:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ pens}}{5 \text{ pens per new pen}} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]

3. **Total Number of Pens:**
   To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens he can create:
   \[
   25 \text{ initial pens} + 5 \text{ new pens} = 30 \text{ pens}
   \]

Therefore, Ram gets to have a total of \( 30 \) pens.

Ingredients for the cake: $12
Birthday presents: $43
Decorations: $15
Invitations: $4
Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, we divide the total cost by 3:

Each person's share = $96 / 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jean needs for the movie:
- She needs 6 hours per day.
- She needs it done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks.

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost without the discount:
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost without discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the discount:
- The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Jean paid after the discount:
Total amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount

Total amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies.

Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \). According to the information given:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Let's denote the number of candies James has as \( J \). According to the information given:
\[ J = R + 6 \]

Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ J = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies.

Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

answer:  To determine the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the books each of them reads.

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. They both read each other's books.

Let's break it down:

- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book.
- Pandora reads her own 2 books.
- Pandora also reads Dolly's 1 book.

Now, let's add up all the books they read:

- Dolly reads 2 books (her own) + 1 book (Pandora's) = 3 books.
- Pandora reads 2 books (her own) + 1 book (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read is:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Dolly's books} + \text{Pandora's books} \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 6 books.

answer:  Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 28 = 2f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave him, we subtract the number of fries he had after Colby took some from the final number of fries:
\[
27 - 7 = 20 \text{ fries}
\]

So, Ginger likely gave Griffin 20 fries.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. Therefore, the number of boys and girls in the school is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

The total number of girls in the first and second classes is:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, there are 17 boys in the third class.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of cows initially in the stalls:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Now, let's find out how many cows are in each of the 20 stalls:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 12 \text{ cows per stall} = 96 \text{ cows} \]

So, there are 96 cows in 8 of the stalls.

answer:  To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Calculate how many times Robert went down the water slide based on Anne's performance.

First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, and Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - (0.30 \times 30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times \text{Anne's times} \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

answer:  To find out how much the chef spent on the onions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the onions.
2. Determine the total cost of the onions based on the price per pound.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the onions:
- The chef bought 4 bags of onions.
- Each bag weighs 50 pounds.

So, the total weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per pound of onions is $1.50.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the onions.

- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, let's calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

- Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies
- Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

- Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies
- Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, let's find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

- Difference in calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

answer:  Let's start by determining the number of apples and bananas each person has.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \( 44 + 4 = 48 \) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the fruits that Andrea and Jamal have:

\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is \( 168 \).

answer:  Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He rides the elevator up to the floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

First, calculate 4 times his starting floor:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Then, add 6 to this result:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

answer:  Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so the total cost for the books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.
Additionally, there is a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book over a week overdue.
Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed each night and then sum them up.

**Last Night:**
- Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Rick killed 15 cougars.

Total animals killed last night:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

**Today:**
- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Rick killed three fewer cougars than last night.

First, calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ wolves} \]

Next, calculate the number of cougars killed today:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

Total animals killed today:
\[ 45 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 57 \text{ animals} \]

Total animals killed:
\[ 25 + 57 = 82 \text{ animals} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Since Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, let's determine the number of trees in Harry's yard. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees in Harry's yard} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard. We do this by subtracting the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees in Harry's yard} - \text{Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total weight of the 200-foot redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the 200-foot tree as follows:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \times 400 \text{ pounds/foot} = 80,000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that the termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find out how much weight the termites ate, we calculate:
\[ 0.30 \times 80,000 \text{ pounds} = 24,000 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the remaining weight of the tree:
\[ 80,000 \text{ pounds} - 24,000 \text{ pounds} = 56,000 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  To find out how much Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Pennies:
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Total value of pennies = 100 pennies * $0.01 per penny = $1.00

2. Nickels:
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Total value of nickels = 40 nickels * $0.05 per nickel = $2.00

3. Dimes:
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Total value of dimes = 20 dimes * $0.10 per dime = $2.00

4. Dollar bills:
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - Total value of dollar bills = 40 dollar bills * $1 per dollar = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

answer:  First, calculate the transfer fees:
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

Next, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
Brokerage fee = $20,000

Now, calculate the total amount paid:
Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
Total amount paid = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
Total amount paid = $282,000

Finally, calculate the net proceeds:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
Net proceeds = $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. Since it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees:

\[ \text{Time to heat from 300 to 400} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.4 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to warm up the oil:

\[ \text{Time to cook} = 20 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add up all the times to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:

\[ \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 63 \text{ minutes} \]

answer:  To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
   So, the second bag has 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   So, the third bag has 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:
\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762
\]

Therefore, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms.

answer:  To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, let's find two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 6,200 \text{ pennies}
\]

Next, we need to convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
6,200 \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

answer:  To determine how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the number of dozens of cookies she is making today and tomorrow.

First, let's find the number of dozens of cookies Carla is making today:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} \div 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 3 \text{ dozens} \]

Next, let's find the number of dozens of cookies Carla is making tomorrow:
\[ 30 \text{ cookies} \div 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 2.5 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of dozens of cookies Carla is making:
\[ 3 \text{ dozens} + 2.5 \text{ dozens} = 5.5 \text{ dozens} \]

Since Carla needs 2 cups of flour for each dozen cookies, the total amount of flour needed is:
\[ 5.5 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour in total.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for each house is:
  \[
  3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows per house}
  \]

Next, let's add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in each house is:
  \[
  6 \text{ windows per house} + 4 \text{ windows per house} = 10 \text{ windows per house}
  \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is:
\[
10 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
\]

#### 20 windows in total.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $<<20*40=800>>800.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $<<80*30=2400>>2400.

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money spent:
- Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $<<800+2400=3200>>3200.

answer:  First, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of the selling price
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
Brokerage fee = $17,500

Next, calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer fee = 12% of the selling price
Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
Transfer fee = $42,000

Now, calculate the total price of the house:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Finally, determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
Difference = Total price - Budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000
Difference = $9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

answer:  To find the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined, we need to calculate how much each girl has and then sum these amounts.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = \text{Carmen's money} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125
   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = \text{Samantha's money} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

Now, we add the amounts of money each girl has:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 = 400
\]

Therefore, all three girls have $400 combined.

answer:  Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( M \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 20:

\[ M + M = 20 \]

We need to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( M + 10 \). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (M + 10) = M + M + 20 \]

We already know that \( M + M = 20 \), so we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

answer:  To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each component and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

Therefore, Sean has to memorize \( \boxed{138} \) lines.

answer:  To find the total amount spent by the real estate agent, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5/ad * 50 ads = $<<5*50=250>>250

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.
- Total cost for television ads = $75/ad * 15 ads = $<<75*15=1125>>1125

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1,375 on buying all the ads.

answer:  Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \), and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Therefore, Sam's current age is \( \boxed{6} \) years old.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people attending the soccer game.

1. There are 12 team members.
2. Each team member brings 2 guests, so there are \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) guests.
3. There are 3 coaches.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so it takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, we calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

answer:  To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length of the sterling silver beads by the length of one sterling silver bead to find the number of beads.

1. The total length of the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is:
   \[

answer:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Let's add these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount the mother paid:

Amount paid: $20.00
Total cost: $15.00

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $15.00

Let's calculate the change:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

answer:  To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the time for small holes:
   - It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - For 30 small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.

2. Calculate the time for large holes:
   - It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
   - For 15 large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.

3. Sum the time for both types of holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew a total of 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

answer:  First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after accounting for the cards with the letter A:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after accounting for the cards with the letter B:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C:
\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D by subtracting the number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards:
\[ 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards with the letter D is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]

answer:  To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the known rows.

1. Three rows of 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Two rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the known rows:
\[
24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars}
\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Therefore, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[
76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars}
\]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row:
\[
\frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows}
\]

Thus, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]
\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:

\[ 2450 \]

answer:  To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that together they have 10 times less medals than the total to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find the number of medals Izzy has:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
- Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 17 medals.
- Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

According to the problem, together they have 10 times less medals than the total. This means the total number of medals given out is \( 39 \times 10 = 390 \).

Therefore, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

answer:  To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
\[ \text{Cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
\[ \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of popsicles} + \text{Cost of ice cream bars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's calculate how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, so we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

2. Calculate the number of oranges washed by the youngest son.
3. Find the total number of oranges washed by both sons.
4. Subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges.

1. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
2. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he washes \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) oranges.
3. The total number of oranges washed by both sons is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \).
4. Will initially bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is \( 15 - 12 = 3 \).

Therefore, 3 oranges are left unwashed.

1. **Alani:**
   - First week: 20 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 20 = 40 stories
   - Total for Alani: 20 + 40 = 60 stories

2. **Braylen:**

   - Second week: 2 * 40 = 80 stories
   - Total for Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120 stories

3. **Margot:**
   - First week: 60 stories
   - Second week: 2 * 60 = 120 stories
   - Total for Margot: 60 + 120 = 180 stories

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by all three:

60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories.

answer:  On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the first day:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 activities

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups
- Ten fewer squats than on the first day: 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses as on the first day: 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total activities on the second day:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 activities

Therefore, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is:
170 activities (first day) + 200 activities (second day) = 370 activities

answer:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance, we use the same formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover 480 miles.

answer:  To determine how much money the desk costs Carmen, we need to follow the sequence of bids:

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. The first person bids once, increasing the bid to $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The second person bids once, increasing the bid to $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The third person bids once, increasing the bid to $300 + $50 = $350.
5. Carmen then bids, increasing the bid to $350 + $50 = $400.

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $400.

answer:  To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Each delivery truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a day:
- Distance to work: 30 miles
- Distance back home: 30 miles
- Total distance per day: 30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles

Next, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year:
- Number of days per week: 5
- Number of weeks per year: 50
- Total distance per year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year

Finally, let's add the monthly bonus:
- Monthly bonus: $150
- Total annual cost: $30000/year + ($150/month * 12 months/year) = $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year

John pays $31800.

answer:  Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount left is:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annika has $15 left.

answer:  First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is under 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add up the points after distributing the extra points:

- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

answer:  Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break in between.

First, let's calculate the total time she spends working:
- From 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
- She takes a 30-minute break.

So, the total time she spends working is 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Next, we need to determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
- 150 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 15 intervals.

Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval:
- 15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the second year.

First, we know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we know that the total number of books over the three years is 250. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 250 - 90 - 50 = 115 \]

Since each book sells for $20, the total earnings for the second year are:
\[ 115 \times 20 = 2300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed 2300 \]

answer:  First, calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

Next, determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
\[ \text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

Then, calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves} \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 5.

answer:  To determine by how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold on the days he was open:
- On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

So, Sam sold 65 crates during the week.

Next, we compare this to his target of 120 crates:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). Therefore, each person consumes:

\[ 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \]

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

\[ 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \times 5 \text{ members} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Finally, we convert days into weeks:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last 3 weeks.

answer:  First, let's determine Joey's weight loss rate. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks):

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 per suit = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 per suitcase = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1250

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$600 + $150 + $1250 + $2000 = $4000

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has left to spend is:
$6000 - $4000 = $2000

Therefore, Theo has $2000 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

answer:  To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, we first need to calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.

Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, he needs to exercise for:

2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes.

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

answer:  To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the structure of the tabloid. Each page of the tabloid is printed on two pieces of paper: one for the left side and one for the right side.

For a 32-page tabloid:
- Page 1 is printed on the left back and right back.
- Page 2 is printed on the left back and right back.
- Page 3 is printed on the left back and right back.
- ...
- Page 32 is printed on the left back and right back.

Since each page is printed on two pieces of paper, we can calculate the total number of pieces of paper as follows:

\[ \text{Total pieces of paper} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Pieces of paper per page} \]

\[ \text{Total pieces of paper} = 32 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total pieces of paper} = 64 \]

Therefore, 64 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.

1. The three people who eat three eggs each day:
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

2. The two people who eat two eggs each day:
   \[
   2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs consumed per day by the entire family:
\[
9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week:
\[
13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}

answer:  Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Given that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{6D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 6D = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ D = \frac{210}{6} = 35 \]

Therefore, there are 35 players on the defense.

First, calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beats 16 people.

Next, subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people to find out how many people he loses to:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

- People who had previous commitments: 2
- Total people who couldn't come: \(8 + 2 = 10\) people

answer:  To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children and then sum them up.

1. **Number of boys:**
   The classroom has 30 boys.

2. **Number of girls:**
   The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of nongendered children:**
   The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total number of children:**
   Add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

- He earns $10 per hour.
- He works 5 days a week.

So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Next, let's add the $300 bonus he receives each week if the company performs well:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April:
- April has 4 weeks.

So, his total earnings for April are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.

answer:  To determine the number of new limbs grown after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs that grow over this period.

1. **Number of new arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every three days.
   - Over fifteen days, the number of new arms is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Number of new legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every five days.
   - Over fifteen days, the number of new legs is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Total number of new limbs:**
   - Adding the number of new arms and legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ arms} + 3 \text{ legs} = 8 \text{ limbs}
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs.

answer:  Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Jam has three boxes, so the total number of pencils Jam has is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 24 + 46 = 70 \]

To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

\[ \frac{70}{8} = 9.75 \]

Since they can't use a fraction of a box, they will need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

answer:  Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) represent the number of electric poles and \( W \) represent the number of electric wires. According to the ratio:

\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. Therefore, we can substitute \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by cross-multiplying:

\[
P \times 3 = 45
\]

\[
P = \frac{45}{3}
\]

\[
P = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

answer:  To determine the population of Chile now, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years old.
   - Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, so Noah was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) years old.

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

3. **Determine the population of Chile now:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \( 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \).

So, the population of Chile is \( \boxed{120000} \).

answer:  To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age is:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is 32 years old.

answer:  Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ x + 5 \]

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off the bus and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream).

1. **Cooling effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - Therefore, the number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \).

2. **Weakness due to ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakness due to ice cubes is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters.

3. **Weakness due to added cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total weakness:**
   - The total weakness is the sum of the weakness due to ice cubes and the weakness due to cream.
   - Total weakness = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times \$0.10 \, \text{per cubic foot} = \$12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

answer:  Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store now is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

His father then gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, the total number of marbles after receiving more from his father is:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

answer:  To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned by the customer.
2. Apply the coupon to the rewards.
3. Subtract the coupon amount from the total spent.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned by the customer.**

The customer spent $43 this shopping trip. The loyalty card gives $1 off for every $20 spent.

\[ \text{Rewards} = \left\lfloor \frac{43}{20} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.15 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

**Step 2: Apply the coupon to the rewards.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.

\[ \text{Coupon amount} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the coupon amount from the total spent.**

\[ \text{Final payment} = 43 - 4 = 39 \]

So, the customer paid $39 on this shopping trip.

6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

So, Oscar has 23 lollipops left.

answer:  The number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.
The number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.
Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.
Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.
The total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

answer:  Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Difference in net pay:
- $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the party initially:

\[ \text{Total people} = 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:

\[ \text{People who left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who stayed is:

\[ \text{People who stayed} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of women who stayed is:

\[ \text{Women who stayed} = 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ women} \]

The number of women who left is:

\[ \text{Women who left} = 15 \text{ women} - 8 \text{ women} = 7 \text{ women} \]

DJ has 8 guns.
Nick has 10 guns.
RJ has 1 gun.
Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ).

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for both the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- He wants to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Total sugar for suckers = 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
- He wants to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Total sugar for fudge = 70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar required:
- Total sugar = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

answer:  Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as \( x \).

According to the problem, each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record. Therefore, each person will receive \( \frac{x}{2} \) new records.

Since there are 5 people, the total number of new records they receive is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \]

We are given that the total number of new records they leave with is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 14 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \]

So, each person brought in 2.8 old records. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records they brought in is:
\[ 5 \times 2.8 = 14 \]

answer:  Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

1. Advance payment: $1,350
2. Monthly installments: 6 installments * $350 per installment = $2,100

Total cost of Furniture United's offer = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:

1. Advance payment: $1,100
2. Monthly installments: 9 installments * $250 per installment = $2,250

Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:

Total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450
Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer: $3,350

Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \). According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

The total number of legs for the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the animals have 160 legs all together.

answer:  To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone, we need to calculate the time required to increase the charge from 60% to 100%.

1. Calculate the percentage increase needed:
   \[
   100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]

2. Determine the rate of charging:
   The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes.

3. Calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{40 \text{ percentage points}}{1 \text{ percentage point per 3 minutes}} = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. Convert the time from minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%.

answer:  Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, which contains 36 cookies.
She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box for 5 days a week, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.
The total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.
Jenny eats the rest of the cookies, which is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.
Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

answer:  Let's determine the weight of each animal based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

answer:  First, we need to determine the new distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice. 

Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. 

To find the additional distance, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new distance Tyson should run each day is:
\[ 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June. June has 30 days.

The total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

answer:  To find the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs:
- There are 40 tables with 4 legs.
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Total legs from tables with 4 legs = 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
- There are 50 tables with 3 legs.
- Each table has 3 legs.
- Total legs from tables with 3 legs = 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
- Total legs = Legs from tables with 4 legs + Legs from tables with 3 legs
- Total legs = 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

Therefore, the restaurant's tables have a total of 310 legs.

answer:  To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts before the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts before the discount:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40% of the total cost:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final price} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts after the 40% discount.

Next, calculate the new price of the stock after the 50% increase:
$8 * 1.50 = $<<8*1.50=12>>12

Then, calculate the total value of the shares after the first year:
8 shares * $12 per share = $<<8*12=96>>96

Now, calculate the new price of the stock after the 25% decrease:
$12 * 0.75 = $<<12*0.75=9>>9

Finally, calculate the total value of the shares after the second year:
8 shares * $9 per share = $<<8*9=72>>72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72.

1. Monday: 1-hour yoga class
2. Tuesday: Cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga
   - Monday’s yoga: 1 hour
   - Tuesday's cooking class: 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours
3. Wednesday: Half-hour cheese-tasting event
4. Thursday: Museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class
   - Tuesday's cooking class: 3 hours
   - Thursday's museum tour: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. Friday: 2 hours of errands

Now, let's add up the durations of all the activities:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total duration = 1 hour + 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, all Peyton’s after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours.

- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Food cost per month = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

Next, calculate the cost of treats per month:
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Treats cost per month = $20/month.

Then, calculate the cost of medicine per month:
- Medicine costs $100 per month.
- Medicine cost per month = $100/month.

Now, add up the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = Food cost per month + Treats cost per month + Medicine cost per month
- Total monthly cost = $100/month + $20/month + $100/month = $220/month.

Finally, calculate the total annual cost:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Total annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12 months/year
- Total annual cost = $220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding her earnings from both jobs:
\[ 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to her current savings:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 275 \text{ dollars} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so Annabelle still needs to save:
\[ 400 \text{ dollars} - 355 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  First, we need to determine how many plant pots are required for the roses. The school asks twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies. Since they asked 30 plant pots for the daisies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of plant pots required for both the daisies and roses:

\[ \text{Total plant pots required} = \text{Plant pots for daisies} + \text{Plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April initially bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots required from the number she bought:

\[ \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Total plant pots bought} - \text{Total plant pots required} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

answer:  To determine how many balls Josh starts to juggle at the talent show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of balls Josh is juggling at the end of the fourth week.
2. Subtract the number of balls lost during the performance.

First, let's find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the end of the fourth week:

- Josh starts juggling 3 balls.
- He adds 1 ball each week.
- By the end of the fourth week, he will be juggling \(3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\) balls.

Next, we need to account for the balls lost during the performance:

- Josh drops 3 balls.
- 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
- 1 ball is lost completely.

So, the total number of balls lost is \(3 - 2 - 1 = 1\) ball.

Finally, we subtract the number of balls lost from the initial number of balls:

- \(6 - 1 = 5\) balls.

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 5 balls.

answer:  To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of the second tree.
2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Use the combined height to find the height of the tallest tree.

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree.
   \[
   \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
   \[
   \text{Combined height of the shortest and second trees} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
   \[
   \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time John spent on all activities.

1. John spent 6 hours boating.
2. He spent half that time swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. He watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.

Adding these times together:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We know that 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent. Let \( T \) be the total time he spent.
\[ 15 = 0.30T \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

The final answer is \( \boxed{20} \).

answer:  To determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the cost of Juice Box B.
2. Find the cost of Juice Box C.
3. Calculate the difference between the cost of Juice Box C and Juice Box B.

First, let's find the cost of Juice Box B:
- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A.
- Therefore, Juice Box B costs \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) dollars.

Next, let's find the cost of Juice Box C:
- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A.
- Therefore, Juice Box C costs \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the difference between the cost of Juice Box C and Juice Box B:
- Juice Box C costs $11.
- Juice Box B costs $9.
- The difference is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.

Thus, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Marisa spends each day on lollipops. Since she buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to $1, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa saves each day. She receives $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, so she saves:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

answer:  First, calculate the daily revenue from making tractors:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors} \times \$100 \text{ per tractor} = \$1000 \]

Next, calculate the daily revenue from making silos:
\[ 5 \text{ silos} \times \$220 \text{ per silo} = \$1100 \]

Now, find the increase in daily revenue:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

Finally, calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Revenue}}{\text{Original Revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now making silos.

answer:  First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is:
\[ \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

For 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing in total.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money Billy had left after buying the gumballs. He started with $10 and spent $2 on gumballs:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy spent half of his remaining change on gumballs, so he spent $4 on gumballs:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he spent $4 on candy. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Billy bought 2 pounds of candy.

1. Mini-golf: $5 per person
2. Arcade tokens: $5 per person
3. Go-karts: $10 per ride, and 2 rides per person, so $10 * 2 = $20 per person

Total cost per person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's determine how many people Morgan can invite with her $90 budget:

Total budget = $90
Cost per person = $30

Number of people = Total budget / Cost per person
Number of people = $90 / $30
Number of people = 3

Therefore, Morgan can invite 3 friends.

answer:  To determine the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test to pass, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total points from the first two tests.
2. Determine the total points needed for all three tests.
3. Subtract the points from the first two tests from the total points needed to find the points required on the third test.

First, let's calculate the total points from the first two tests:
- Points from the first test: 15
- Points from the second test: 18
- Total points from the first two tests: \( 15 + 18 = 33 \)

Next, we know the total points needed for all three tests is at least 42:
- Total points needed: 42

Now, we subtract the points from the first two tests from the total points needed to find the points required on the third test:
- Points needed on the third test: \( 42 - 33 = 9 \)

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

The final answer is:

answer:  First, calculate the time John took to drive to his friend's house:
- Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
- Speed: 70 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 30 hours

Next, calculate the total distance including the detour:
- Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
- Detour: 10 miles
- Total distance = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Now, calculate the time John took to drive home:
- Distance home: 240 miles
- Speed: 80 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Finally, add the times for both legs of the trip to find the total time:
- Time to his friend's house: 30 hours
- Time to drive home: 3 hours
- Total time = 30 hours + 3 hours = 33 hours

Therefore, the total time for John's trip is 33 hours.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one round trip:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city to the first city: (75 + 100) - 50 = 125 miles

So, the total distance for one round trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the distance it travels in one day:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

answer:  To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Given:
- There are 6 girls in the park.
- There are twice the number of boys in the park.

Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of girls is twice the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ 6 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ B = 3 \]

So, there are 3 boys in the park.

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of girls and the number of boys:
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 9.

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the toy cars:
\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the teddy bears:
\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, add the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean initially had \$28. After spending \$17, he has:
\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra \$10:
\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, Dean has \$21 left.

answer:  First, we need to determine the amount saved by the DIY project. Since the DIY project saves 20% of the original price, we calculate:

\[ \text{Savings} = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the savings from the original price to find the DIY cost:

\[ \text{DIY Cost} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

1. **For refusing to wear masks:**
   \[
   3 \text{ customers}
   \]

2. **For shoplifting:**
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \text{ customers}
   \]

3. **For physical violence over goods on sale:**
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ customers}
   \]

Next, we add up the number of customers kicked out for these reasons:
\[
3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \text{ customers}
\]

The total number of customers kicked out is 50. To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of customers kicked out for the specified reasons from the total number of customers kicked out:
\[
50 - 31 = 19 \text{ customers}
\]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[
19 \text{ customers}
\]

answer:  Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find the age of Carver's son, we need to solve this equation for \( x \).

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5 \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

answer:  Mary has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 sheep.
She gets 1 kg of milk from each of these 15 sheep, so she collects 15 * 1 = <<15*1=15>>15 kg of milk from them.
The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep, and she gets 2 kg of milk from each of them, so she collects 15 * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 kg of milk from them.
Therefore, Mary collects a total of 15 + 30 = <<15+30=45>>45 kg of milk every day.

answer:  To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then sum them up.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Saturday = 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday = 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
   - However, six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, we sum up the number of pairs sold each day:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of the picture frames:
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- The etching cost is 20% of $20, which is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost per picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

Next, calculate the cost of the pins:
- Each pin costs $5.
- 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Then, calculate the cost of the cords:
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.
- Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, add up all the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: 44 * $24 = $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132

Total amount spent:
$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

answer:  To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fourth-grade boys.
2. Determine the number of fourth-grade boys absent on Friday.
3. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present.

First, let's find the total number of fourth-grade boys:
- Total number of fourth-graders = 96
- Number of girls = 43
- Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls
- Number of boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Next, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday:
- Number of boys absent = 4

Now, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present:
- Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
- Number of boys present = 53 - 4 = 49

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total value of the faulty equipment.
2. Subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment to find the value of the functioning equipment.

First, let's calculate the total value of the faulty equipment:
\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 40\% \text{ of } \$400,000 \]
\[ \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = \$160,000 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value of the equipment:
\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = \text{Total value} - \text{Value of faulty equipment} \]
\[ \text{Value of functioning equipment} = \$400,000 - \$160,000 = \$240,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \$240,000.

answer:  To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the total number of socks in the pairs:
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
- Each pair consists of 2 socks.

So, the total number of socks in the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Next, let's add the loose socks:
- Lindsay washes 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

answer:  Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
In total, Axel has 50 silver pesos + 80 gold pesos = 130 pesos.
In total, Anna has 100 silver pesos + 120 gold pesos = 220 pesos.
Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 130 pesos + 220 pesos = 350 pesos.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy made $56 from selling the apples.
   - The price per apple is $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) apples.

Now, we sum the number of apples picked each day:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total number of apples picked over the three days:
\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

**Answer:** 50

answer:  To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify how many points Sara scored.
2. Determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points.
3. Subtract the 14 points Erin scored from her current total to find out how many points she had before.

1. Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Erin's points after 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
3. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current total:
   \[
   \text{Erin's points before 14} = \text{Erin's points after 14} - \text{Points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10
   \]

Therefore, Erin had \boxed{10} points before scoring 14 points.

answer:  To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

First, we add up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of test scores to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

answer:  To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Cho = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Chloe = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance_Cho - Distance_Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

answer:  Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue from selling all the cups is 36 * $1 = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost (the cost of supplies) from her total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $36 - $18 = $18

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours she spends running her lemonade stand, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:

Total Hours = Total Cups / Cups per Hour
Total Hours = 36 / 4 = 9 hours

To find her profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total number of hours:

Profit per Hour = Total Profit / Total Hours
Profit per Hour = $18 / 9 = $2

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour running her lemonade stand.

answer:  To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Determine the total amount of ribbon she has.
3. Divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- She has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Next, we know she has 144 inches of ribbon.

Now, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift:
Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total number of gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is \boxed{12} inches.

answer:  To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- There are 6 erasers.
- Therefore, the cost of the erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = $<<6 \times 2=12>>12 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- There are 8 pencils.
- Therefore, the cost of the pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = $<<8 \times 3=24>>24 \).

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of erasers + Cost of pencils
- Total cost = $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the members are boys and 50% are girls:

- Number of boys = 52 members * 50% = 26 boys
- Number of girls = 52 members * 50% = 26 girls

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of girls performing is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it to the show:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 26 girls / 2 = 13 girls

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Number of girls performing = 26 girls - 13 girls = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls, so the total number of people singing in the performance is:

- Total number of people singing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
- Total number of people singing = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

#### 16 people sang in the performance.

answer:  Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combine like terms:

\[11x = 165\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\)
- Sam's popsicles: \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\).

answer:  To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total interest over five months.
2. Add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid.
3. Divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total interest over five months. The interest rate is 10%, so the total interest is:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 = 365 \]

Next, we add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount to be Paid} = 3650 + 365 = 4015 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{4015}{5} = 803 \]

So, Karan has to pay $803 per month.

\boxed{803}

answer:  To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Millipedes:**
   - Nancy saw \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many millipedes as spiders.
   - Number of millipedes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).

3. **Stink Bugs:**
   - The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   - Number of stink bugs = \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, we add up all the bugs:
- Number of spiders = 90
- Number of millipedes = 30
- Number of stink bugs = 48

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so:

\[ \text{Total cost for Dasha} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David to buy a ride bracelet for all 9 rides. The ride bracelet costs $30, so:

\[ \text{Total cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much money David saves by comparing the total cost for Dasha to the total cost for David:

\[ \text{Amount saved} = \text{Total cost for Dasha} - \text{Total cost for David} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides.

Now, subtract the cards she passed out:
\[ 50 \text{ cards} - 24 \text{ cards} - 5 \text{ cards} = 21 \text{ cards} \]

Finally, add the cards she received from family and friends:
\[ 21 \text{ cards} + 17 \text{ cards} = 38 \text{ cards} \]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

answer:  Let \( x \) be the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

After selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he had 12.8 hectares left. This can be expressed as:
\[ x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{5}{5}x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Calculate the product:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

answer:  Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk required for a normal batch.

For a normal batch:
- Flour: 3 cups
- Milk: 1 cup

For a quadruple batch:
- Flour: 4 * 3 cups = 12 cups
- Milk: 4 * 1 cup = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so Mark needs:
- 12 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs:
- 4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- Number of bags of flour: 6
- Number of bottles of milk: 2

Difference: 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

answer:  First, calculate the total time Carol spends on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: Half of 4 hours, which is 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
- Editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Next, calculate the total time spent on all activities:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours

Now, calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
Percentage spent editing = (Editing time / Total time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (1 / 5) * 100
Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage spent editing = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, let's find Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Beth's age} = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, let's find Alice's age:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Alice's age} = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Now, we calculate the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:
\[ \text{Difference in ages} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} \]
\[ \text{Difference in ages} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

answer:  To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu, and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. James delivers \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
\]

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = 22
\]

Now, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total:

\[
\text{Total messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu}
\]

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22
\]

\[
\text{Total messages} = 88
\]

Therefore, James delivers a total of \(88\) messages.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of corns Allan initially has. Since he has twice as much corn as as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Finally, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} \]

\[ \text{Combined total} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

answer:  To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money to buy the bike, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save.
2. Determine how much money Mark already has.
3. Calculate the additional amount Mark needs to save.
4. Determine how many days it will take for Mark to save the additional amount.

1. The total amount of money Mark needs to save is $300.
2. Mark already has $50 in his bank account.
3. The additional amount Mark needs to save is:
   \[
   300 - 50 = 250
   \]
4. Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save the additional $250, we divide the additional amount by his daily earnings:
   \[
   \frac{250}{10} = 25
   \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save his money for 25 days to have enough to buy the bike.

So, the number of days Mark has to save is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]

answer:  Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts/day} \]

If he reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will use:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts/day} \]

The difference in energy usage per day is:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts/day} - 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 4500 \text{ watts/day} \]

To convert this to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:
\[ 4500 \text{ watts/day} \div 1000 = 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \]

Over 30 days, Mel saves:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kW}

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the streaming services without the discount:
- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu: $10 per month
- Disney Plus: $10 per month

Total cost without discount = $10 + $10 + $10 = $30 per month

Next, apply the 20% discount for bundling:
- Discount amount = 20% of $30 = 0.20 * $30 = $6

Total cost with discount = $30 - $6 = $24 per month

Now, compare the total cost of the streaming services with the cost of the cable package:
- Cable package cost: $60 per month
- Streaming services cost: $24 per month

Savings per month = $60 - $24 = $36 per month

To find the annual savings, multiply the monthly savings by 12:
- Annual savings = $36 per month * 12 months = $432 per year

Therefore, Tim saves $432 per year by cancelling his $60 cable package.

answer:  Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy at a rate of "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." This means she pays for 2 pounds of taffy, and each pound costs $3.

Cost of taffy:
2 pounds * $3 per pound = $<<2*3=6>>6

Sally also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

Cost of seashells:
$1.50

Cost of magnets:
4 magnets * $0.25 per magnet = $<<4*0.25=1>>1

Total cost of all items:
$6 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (agnets) = $<<6+1.50+1=8.50>>8.50

Sally started with $10 and spent $8.50:
$10 - $8.50 = $<<10-8.50=1.50>>1.50

answer:  To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:**
   - The builder works 4 weeks every month.
   - The builder works 6 days every week.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a month is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) days.

2. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a year is \( 24 \times 12 = 288 \) days.

3. **Calculate the builder's daily earnings:**
   - The builder gets paid $50 every day.

4. **Calculate the builder's annual earnings:**
   - Multiply the number of days worked in a year by the daily wage.
   - Therefore, the annual earnings are \( 288 \times 50 = 14,400 \) dollars.

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps} \]

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total number of steps he has taken so far is:

\[ 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

After finishing his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

\[ 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps} \]

answer:  First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we add the number of slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the number of slices given away from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Jenny eats:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, there are 3 slices left.

answer:  To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse.
2. Determine the discounted price per blouse.
3. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses.

1. **Discount amount per blouse:**
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30% of $20.
   - \( 30\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Discounted price per blouse:**
   - The discounted price is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 4 blouses:**
   - Multiply the discounted price per blouse by the number of blouses.
   - \( \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

answer:  Tyson needs to serve 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people, so he needs to make 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches.
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so each sandwich requires 1 + 1 = 2 pounds of meat and cheese combined.
For 5 sandwiches, he will need 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 pounds of meat and cheese.
The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 10 pounds of meat will cost 10 * 7 = $<<10*7=70.00>>70.00.
The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 10 pounds of cheese will cost 10 * 3 = $<<10*3=30.00>>30.00.
The total cost for the meat and cheese is $70.00 + $30.00 = $<<70+30=100.00>>100.00.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.
- Total cost before discount: $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
- Discount amount: 20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
- Total cost after discount: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework:
- The finale firework costs $150.
- Total amount spent: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent a total of $1110.

answer:  To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's and Zack's lockers.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker.
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

answer:  In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.
The total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $<<40*15*40=24000>>24000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 1/4 * 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees lost their contracts.
The number of employees remaining in June is 40 - 10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount paid in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $<<30*15*40=18000>>18000.

The total amount paid in the two months is $24000 + $18000 = $<<24000+18000=42000>>42000.

answer:  Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \( x \).

Joanne gathers:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- 15 apples from the shortest trees (half of 30)
- \( x \) apples from the average trees

Joanne's sister gathers:
- 2 \times 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees
- 3 \times 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees
- 0 apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is:
\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 40 + x + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 140 + x = 500 \]

Subtracting 140 from both sides:
\[ x = 500 - 140 \]
\[ x = 360 \]

So, Joanne gathered 360 apples from the average trees.

answer:  To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Calculate the total number of stripes:
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
   - One zebra with half as many stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

   Adding these together:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. Count the number of zebras:
   - There are 4 zebras.

3. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months at the introductory price of $8 per month:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8 \text{ per month} = \$48 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 8 months at the normal price of $12 per month:
\[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12 \text{ per month} = \$96 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost for the next 8 months at the increased price of $14 per month:
\[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14 \text{ per month} = \$112 \]

Now, let's add up the costs for one year:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

Since we need to find the cost for 2 years, we multiply the cost of one year by 2:
\[ \$256 \times 2 = \$512 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$512 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words}\]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at a rate of 300 words per minute:
\[\frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}\]

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time it takes to finish the book and get to the airport from the time he needs to be there:
\[60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}\]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

answer:  To determine the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are more likely to explode.
2. Determine how many of those candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that are more likely to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are more likely to explode.

\[ \text{Number of more likely to explode candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 5000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these more likely to explode candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more likely to explode candles have this defect.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 0.05 \times 5000 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 250.

answer:  To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Determine the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver.

1. The elevation of Stanley's comb is 4,000 feet below Stanley's original elevation. Since Stanley's original elevation is 10,000 feet, the elevation of the comb is:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Oliver's elevation is given as 3,000 feet.

3. The difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation is:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

answer:  To determine the total cost Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 0.25 \times 4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half of the price of the bagel:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Therefore, in 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, and 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are required to make 60 cookies.

To do this, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the next 2 days:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \text{ km} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the second week:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Finally, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

answer:  First, let's determine the original price of the jogger jeans. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28. Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Therefore, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The amount saved from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in price is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost 6 dollars less than the tattered jeans.

1. Set of pot and pans: $120.00
2. Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
3. 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: \( 5 \times 5.00 = 25.00 \)

Total cost before discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \text{ of } 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:

\[ \text{Final cost} = 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is **$132.00**.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of cats carried away by the boats:
\[ 4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats per boat} = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Next, subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats:
\[ 50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Now, calculate the number of cats that ran after the mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 \text{ cats} = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Finally, subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 \text{ cats} - 18 \text{ cats} = 12 \text{ cats} \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

answer:  Let \( C \) be the number of camels and \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, substitute \( C = 180 - D \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]

Simplify and solve for \( D \):
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 304 = D \]
\[ 56 = D \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

answer:  Kenny needs to buy a ticket for $100 and has $50 in spending cash, so he needs a total of $100 + $50 = $150.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as \( x \).

The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 1 \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \]

We know that this amount is equal to $150:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 150 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \times \frac{3}{2} = 225 \]

So, Kenny started with 225 Pokemon cards.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money he had left after buying the chips. George spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. He had 1% of his money left:
\[ 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

So, he had 5 cents left after buying the chips. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy bars is:
\[ 500 - 120 - 5 = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{375}{75} = 5 \]

Thus, George bought 5 candy bars.

The number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]

answer:  To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second company.
2. Add the amounts received from both banks.
3. Add the total amount received to his initial capital.

First, let's find out how much money Mr. Josue received from the second company. The second company gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second company gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Finally, we add the total amount received to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital, so his new capital is:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]

answer:  Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more, making a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each self-made bird feeder attracts 10 more birds, so each self-made bird feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is:
\[ 3 \text{ store-bought feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

The total number of birds attracted by the self-made bird feeders is:
\[ 3 \text{ self-made feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders:
\[ 60 \text{ birds} + 90 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

answer:  To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items.
2. Determine the amount of money Dora already has.
3. Subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost to find out how much more she needs.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's determine the amount of money Dora already has:
- Dora has saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost to find out how much more she needs:
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

answer:  To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - There are 4 buses.
   - Each bus can hold 60 employees.
   - Total capacity for buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.

2. **Minibusses:**
   - There are 6 minibusses.
   - Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
   - Total capacity for minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.

3. **Minivans:**
   - There are 10 minivans.
   - Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
   - Total capacity for minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees

answer:  To determine the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide by the number of servings.

1. **Cost of onions:**
   - Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 4 pounds.
   - The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound.
   - Total cost for onions = 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

2. **Cost of beef stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - The cost of one box of beef stock is $2.00.
   - Total cost for beef stock = 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

4. **Cost per serving:**
   - Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings = $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

1. Identify the number of letters in Indras' name.
2. Calculate the number of letters in Indras' sister's name.
3. Add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to get the total.

1. Indras' name has 6 letters.
2. Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   Adding 4 to this number gives:
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7
   \]
   So, Indras' sister's name has 7 letters.
3. Now, add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name:
   \[
   6 + 7 = 13
   \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

4. Ray shared the remaining 20 lollipops equally with his four friends.
5. Divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ lollipops}}{4 \text{ friends}} = 5 \text{ lollipops per friend}
   \]

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received \boxed{5} lollipops.

answer:  The food caterer initially prepared hot dogs for 36 guests. Half of the guests would have two hot dogs each, so:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests} \]

Each of these 18 guests would have 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs} \]

The caterer initially prepared 36 hot dogs, so the number of hot dogs short is:

\[ 80 - 36 = 44 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

\[ \frac{44}{2} = 22 \text{ guests} \]

Therefore, 22 guests did not get a second hot dog.

answer:  First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to baking. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and each hour increases the temperature by 5 degrees.

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to opening the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ intervals} \]
\[ 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this from the current temperature:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container contains:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container to run her lawnmower. Since each container holds 3 gallons, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container holds:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in 1 gallon. Therefore, 0.75 gallons is equivalent to:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

The answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]

answer:  To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons}
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons}
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons}
   \]

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

answer:  To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne, we need to calculate the total travel time for both Wayne and Bernadette and then find the difference.

1. **Wayne's Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's Travel Time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Desired Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's total travel time should be \( 16 - 5 = 11 \) minutes.

4. **Difference in Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's total travel time is 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's total travel time is 11 minutes.
   - The difference in travel time is \( 11 - 4 = 7 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 7 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives at the theater first.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we add the 2 loose eggs:

\[ 48 \text{ eggs} + 2 \text{ eggs} = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so for each tray that holds 5 glasses, she needs:

\[ 5 \text{ glasses/tray} \times 5 \text{ eggs/glass} = 25 \text{ eggs/tray} \]

To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{25 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays.

answer:  First, we need to find the total number of oranges bought by Sitti and Juris.

Sitti bought 34 oranges.
Juris bought 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Next, we need to determine how many people will share the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 friends, so there are a total of 2 + 6 = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get.

Oranges per person = 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.

1. Calculate the weight of one piece of cake.
2. Determine the total weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom.
3. Subtract the total weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake.

1. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the weight of one piece is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}

2. Rory and her mom each take one piece, so the total weight of the pieces taken is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. Subtract the total weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake:

answer:  To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth has:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads.
- Elizabeth bought 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Total beads Elizabeth has = (1 pack * 20 beads) + (2 packs * 20 beads) = 20 + 40 beads = 60 beads

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth has:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads.
- Margareth bought 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Total beads Margareth has = (3 packs * 20 beads) + (4 packs * 20 beads) = 60 + 80 beads = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Elizabeth and Margareth:
Difference = 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads

answer:  First, let's calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time must be 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Now, let's calculate James's time for each segment:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes
- Bike: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon, so he takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes
- Run: Let's denote James's run time as R minutes.

James's total time = 36 + 85 + R = 160 minutes

Solving for R:
R = 160 - 121
R = 39 minutes

So, it took James 39 minutes to run the triathlon.

answer:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

When you buy the super ticket, you pay $20 for the movie and $1 for the popcorn and soda, so the total cost with the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

When you buy the regular ticket, you pay $12 for the movie, \( P \) for popcorn, and $3 for the soda, so the total cost with the regular ticket is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you save $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the difference between the cost of the regular ticket and the cost of the super ticket is $2:
\[ (15 + P) - 21 = 2 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 15 + P - 21 = 2 \]
\[ P - 6 = 2 \]

Adding 6 to both sides:
\[ P = 2 + 6 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

answer:  First, we need to determine Joey's new score after his turn. Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 points:

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

So, Joey has 240 points after his turn.

Next, we determine Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 points:

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy has 235 points after her turn.

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's scores:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Therefore, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A was 20 minutes long.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.

30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we calculate the number of bails of hay needed. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, we have:

Number of bails = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Each bail costs $3, so:

Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 bills * $5/bill = $30

Finally, we find the change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

Michael will have $6 in change after buying the hay.

answer:  To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of apples both people eat in one day.
3. Calculate the number of apples both people eat in 30 days.

First, we know that each person eats 4 apples a day.

Next, we calculate the number of apples both people eat in one day. Since there are two people, we multiply the number of apples each person eats by 2:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/person/day} \times 2 \text{ people} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the number of apples both people eat in 30 days. We multiply the number of apples both people eat in one day by the number of days:
\[ 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240 apples.

answer:  To determine the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of colors in the six packets that each have eight colors:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ colors per packet} = 48 \text{ colors} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of colors in the four packets that each have sixteen colors:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ colors per packet} = 64 \text{ colors} \]

Now, we add the number of colors from both types of packets to find the total number of colors:
\[ 48 \text{ colors} + 64 \text{ colors} = 112 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons.

answer:  To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale:
- He sold 17 sneakers at $20 each.
- Revenue from flash sale = 17 * $20 = $340.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold to the department store:
- He sold the remaining 31 sneakers at $25 each.
- Revenue from department store = 31 * $25 = $775.

Now, let's find the total revenue from all the sales:
- Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store
- Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115.

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of the sneakers from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Cost of the sneakers
- Profit = $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit was $539.

answer:  To determine how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original cost per balloon.
2. Determine the new cost per balloon after the increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the original cost per balloon:
- Total cost to fill 20 balloons: $900
- Original cost per balloon: $900 / 20 = $45

Next, let's determine the new cost per balloon after the increase:
- Increase in cost per balloon: $20
- New cost per balloon: $45 + $20 = $65

Now, let's calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:
- New cost per balloon: $65
- Number of balloons: 170
- Total cost: $65 * 170 = $10950

Therefore, Bentley paid $10950 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots. The formula for percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

answer:  First, calculate the volume of one raised bed:
- Volume = width × length × height
- Volume = 2 feet × 8 feet × 2 feet
- Volume = 32 cubic feet

Next, calculate the total volume needed for all 10 raised beds:
- Total volume = volume of one bed × number of beds
- Total volume = 32 cubic feet × 10
- Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, determine how many bags of potting soil are needed:
- Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
- Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag
- Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag
- Number of bags = 160 bags

Finally, calculate the total cost of the potting soil:
- Each bag costs $12.
- Total cost = number of bags × cost per bag
- Total cost = 160 bags × $12 per bag
- Total cost = $1920

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920.

answer:  To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, add the distances from both segments of the trip to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Then, add the times for both segments of the trip to find the total time:
- Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, divide the total distance by the total time to find the average speed:
- Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes x 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags x 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales x 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks x 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:

Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip ≈ 2.00 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 3 trips.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fairies:**
   Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

2. **Fairies joining from the east:**
   One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half as many is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   So, 25 fairies joined from the east.

3. **Total number of fairies after the fairies joined:**
   Adding the 25 fairies from the east to the initial 50 fairies:
   \[
   50 + 25 = 75
   \]

4. **Fairies flying away:**
   Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Subtracting these 30 fairies from the total:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45
   \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[
####{45}
\]

answer:  First, calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- Total cost before discount: 20 apples * 45 cents/apple = $9.00
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Final cost for Becky: $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

Next, calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- Total cost before discount: 20 apples * 50 cents/apple = $10.00
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount.
- Discount amount: $10.00 * 0.10 = $1.00
- Final cost for Kelly: $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Now, find the difference in cost between Kelly and Becky:
- Difference: Kelly's final cost - Becky's final cost
- Difference: $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

answer:  To find the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of red, green, and yellow cards and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards.
   - So, the number of yellow cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards is \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is \( 78 \).

answer:  To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the pizza.
2. Determine the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the pizza cost.
3. Add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount.

1. The cost of the pizza is $15.
2. The tip amount is 1/5 of $15:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3
   \]
3. The total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is the sum of the pizza cost and the tip:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 15 + 3 = 18
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18.

answer:  To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plants Toni has.
2. Determine the number of plants Shondra has based on the information given.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants.

\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = \text{Number of plants Frederick has} + 60\% \text{ of Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.

\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = \text{Number of plants Toni has} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has \( 9 \) plants.

1. Identify the cost of the pen.
2. Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
3. Find the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper.
4. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier to find the change.

1. The cost of the pen is $2.
2. The cost of the piece of paper is $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is \(3 \times 2 = 6\). Therefore, the cost of the piece of paper is \(6 - 1 = 5\).
3. The total cost of the pen and the piece of paper is the sum of the cost of the pen and the cost of the piece of paper, which is \(2 + 5 = 7\).
4. Theo gave the cashier $10. The amount of change she received is the difference between the amount she gave and the total cost, which is \(10 - 7 = 3\).

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is \(\boxed{3}\).

answer:  To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles.
2. Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:

- Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth 2 cents.
  - Earnings from aluminum cans per week = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

- Grayson recycles 5 plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
  - Earnings from plastic bottles per week = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents per week.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:

- Total earnings for a four-week month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:
\[ \text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has:
\[ \text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:
\[ \text{Total cards} = 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ \text{Cards given to students} = 350 - 50 = 300 \]

Each student receives 10 cards, so the number of students is:
\[ \text{Number of students} = \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students with a desktop computer is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).

We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means that the number of students without a desktop computer is 20.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students with a desktop computer and students without a desktop computer:
\[ x = \frac{3}{4}x + 20 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ x - \frac{3}{4}x = 20 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4}x = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

answer:  To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we first need to calculate the number of pieces of laundry in one room and then multiply that by 80.

1. **Sheets**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we add up all the pieces of laundry in one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total per room: \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\) pieces

For 80 rooms, the total is:

answer:  To determine Finley's final position, we need to follow the sequence of her movements in the race:

1. She started in 1st place.
2. She fell back 5 spots:
   \[
   1 - 5 = -4
   \]
   So, she is in 4th place.
3. She moved ahead 2 spots:
   \[
   -4 + 2 = -2
   \]
   So, she is in 2nd place.
4. She fell back 3 spots:
   \[
   -2 - 3 = -5
   \]
   So, she is in 5th place.
5. She jumped ahead 1 spot:
   \[
   -5 + 1 = -4
   \]
   So, she is in 4th place.

Since the race has 10 participants, we need to convert the negative position back to a positive position within the 10 participants:
\[
-4 + 10 = 6
\]

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 6th place.

answer:  To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides} \]

Now, we add the number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 621 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 621 people.

answer:  To determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with the sprinkles.
2. Determine how many pans are needed to hold that number of cupcakes, given that each pan holds 12 cupcakes.

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with the sprinkles:

- Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles.
- Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes.

So, the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pans are required to hold 48 cupcakes, given that each pan holds 12 cupcakes:

- Each pan holds 12 cupcakes.

So, the number of pans needed is:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes per pan}} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils} \]

Next, we find out how many pencils were used after two months:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 \text{ pencils} = 60 \text{ pencils} \]

So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 \text{ pencils} - 60 \text{ pencils} = 240 \text{ pencils} \]

At the end of the year, only \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining pencils were left:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 \text{ pencils} = 80 \text{ pencils} \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ 240 \text{ pencils} - 80 \text{ pencils} = 160 \text{ pencils} \]

answer:  To determine how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to account for the number of shoes he gains and loses throughout the week.

1. **Initial number of shoes:**
   Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes gained on Monday:**
   He gains 5 pairs of shoes.
   \[
   200 + 5 = 205
   \]

3. **Shoes gained on Wednesday:**
   He gains 15 new pairs of shoes.
   \[
   205 + 15 = 220
   \]

4. **Shoes gained on Friday:**
   He gains 30 more pairs of shoes.
   \[
   220 + 30 = 250
   \]

5. **Shoes lost on Saturday:**
   He gets rid of 180 shoes.
   \[
   250 - 180 = 70
   \]

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 70 shoes on Sunday.

answer:  To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to walk.
2. Divide the total minutes of walking required by the total number of days.

First, let's find the total number of days Jason has to walk:
- Jason wants to try out in three weeks.
- He can walk 4 days a week.

So, the total number of days he has to walk is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we divide the total minutes of walking required by the total number of days:
- It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes.
- He has 12 days to walk.

So, the time he has to spend walking each day is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the shark to the same unit as the remoras. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark is 10 feet long, which is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:

\[ 6 \text{ inches/remora} \times 2 \text{ remoras} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

answer:  To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles James runs in a week.
2. Convert the total miles into hours based on his running speed.

First, let's calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.
\[ \text{Total miles per week} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Total miles per week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total miles into hours. James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = \frac{\text{Total miles per week}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours a week.

answer:  Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat as \( x \).

According to his dad's rule, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Therefore, the total number of cookies Matt can have is:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total according to his dad's rule.

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

answer:  To determine how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- \( D \) is the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) is the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \)
- \( |P| = 6 \)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \)

The principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets states:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

answer:  To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Cost of the plane tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - There are 2 people, so the total cost for the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

2. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive during a busy weekend, so the increased price per day is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel stay is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

3. **Total cost of the trip:**
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay: $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15400.

answer:  To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received.

First, let's find the total number of books Sarah bought. She spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15.

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15}
\]

\[
\frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

So, Sarah bought 20 books.

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of children to find out how many books each child received.

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4}
\]

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

answer:  To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 36 + 48 \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining amount the child needs to save.
2. Determine how many days it will take to save the remaining amount if the child saves $2 daily.

First, let's find the remaining amount the child needs to save:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total cost of the toy car} - \text{Amount already saved} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$12 - \$4 \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$8 \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take to save the remaining $8 if the child saves $2 daily:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Daily savings}} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\$8}{\$2} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money if he promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.

answer:  To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel, we first need to calculate the number of songs each person has on their player.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, and he currently has 20 songs. Therefore, Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, and she currently has 60 songs. Therefore, Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs.

answer:  To determine how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow paint tubes he has based on the information given.

1. **Blue Paint:**
   - Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.
   - Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   - Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.
   - Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue paint tubes and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint} = \text{Blue paint tubes} + \text{Yellow paint tubes} \]
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint} = 2 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint} = 11 \]

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total.

answer:  First, calculate the total height of each layer of the human pyramid:

1. Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders * 64 inches each = 256 inches
2. Second layer: 3 cheerleaders * 64 inches each = 192 inches
3. Third layer: 2 cheerleaders * 64 inches each = 128 inches
4. Top layer: 1 cheerleader * 60 inches = 60 inches

Next, sum the heights of all the layers to get the total height of the human pyramid:

Total height = 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches

Finally, convert the total height from inches to feet:

Total height in feet = 636 inches / 12 inches per foot = 53 feet

answer:  To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.
2. Determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up based on the number of oranges he ate.

First, let's find out how many oranges Stetson ate:

Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges they picked. They picked 60 oranges.

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. According to the bet, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats.

\[
\text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, Stetson gave up \( \boxed{240} \).

answer:  To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses for five days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day.
2. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in five days.
3. Determine how many bags of oats are needed based on the total consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day:
- Each horse consumes 5 pounds per meal.
- Each horse is fed twice a day.
- Therefore, each horse consumes 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in five days:
- Each horse consumes 10 pounds/day * 5 days = 50 pounds.
- Four horses consume 50 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 200 pounds.

Finally, let's determine how many bags of oats are needed:
- Each bag contains 50 pounds.
- Uncle Ben needs 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

answer:  To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest temperature recorded in each country.
2. Add the highest temperatures together.
3. Divide the sum by the number of countries.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, add these temperatures together:
\[ -48 + 21 + (-3) \]

First, add the positive numbers:
\[ -48 + 21 = -27 \]
\[ -27 + (-3) = -30 \]

So, the sum of the highest temperatures is -30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3):
\[ \frac{-30}{3} = -10 \]

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Answer: -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

answer:  To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays.
2. Subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays:
- Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
- Jaime has 2 trays.

So, the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs:
- Jaime has 64 eggs in total.
- He can place 48 eggs on the trays.

So, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the trays is:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

answer:  First, determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Since the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3:

\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, Sally spends $32 in total.

1. For the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
   \[
   2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

2. For the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
   \[
   3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts}
   \]

3. Adding the gifts from both groups:
   \[
   10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts}
   \]

4. Adding the additional 10 random gifts:
   \[
   16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}
   \]

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

answer:  First, determine the total number of razors Heather gets from 2 packs:

2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors

Next, apply the "buy one get one free" offer. Since she buys 2 packs, she gets 8 razors for the price of 4 razors:

8 razors / 2 = 4 razors

Now, calculate the cost of the 4 razors at the regular price:

2 packs * $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Apply the $2.00 coupon:

$8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00

Finally, determine the cost per individual razor:

$6.00 / 4 razors = $1.50 per razor

Convert the cost per razor from dollars to cents:

$1.50 * 100 = 150 cents per razor

So, each individual razor will cost 150 cents after the discount.

answer:  To determine Angela's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Brett's current age.
2. Determine Brett's age in four years.
3. Calculate Angela's age in four years based on the given relationship.
4. Find Angela's current age by subtracting four years from her age in four years.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, Angela will be:
   \[
   3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years:
   \[
   42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in one day:
- Morning rides: 2
- Afternoon rides: 2
- Total rides per day: 2 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 4 rides

Next, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days: 4 rides/day * 14 days = 56 rides

Now, calculate the cost of each type of ride:
- Morning ride cost: $6
- Afternoon ride cost: $2

Calculate the total cost for each type of ride:
- Total cost for morning rides: 56 rides * $6/ride = $336
- Total cost for afternoon rides: 56 rides * $2/ride = $112

Finally, calculate the total cost for all rides:
- Total cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $336 + $112 = $448

So, Paul spent $448 on driving his car during these 14 days.

answer:  Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each person is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost per person is $25.
- Food is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25x \).

To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we set the total costs equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10 guests.

answer:  Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \). According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, which is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

answer:  Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th, which is 7 months from December 31st. 

First, let's calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 201 days

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 201 days ≈ 524 calories/day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 524 calories to reach his goal.

answer:  To determine the length of the couch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the width of the rug.
2. Use the width of the rug to find the length of the couch.

**Step 1: Find the width of the rug.**

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, we calculate the width of the rug as follows:
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Use the width of the rug to find the length of the couch.**

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, we calculate the length of the couch as follows:
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is \(18\) feet.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn altogether.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \) dollars.

Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \) dollars.

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2.

She bought one pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry, grape, and green apple gum:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

answer:  To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her weekly bus trips.

Janet takes two bus trips per day for five days a week:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, if Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

- Four $10 bills: 4 * $10 = $40
- Six $20 bills: 6 * $20 = $120
- Total: $40 + $120 = $160

Next, determine how much money Ali gives to his sister:
- Half of $160: $160 / 2 = $80

Then, calculate the remaining money after giving some to his sister:
- Remaining money: $160 - $80 = $80

Now, determine how much money Ali uses to buy dinner:
- 3/5 of $80: (3/5) * $80 = $48

Finally, calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner:
- Amount left: $80 - $48 = $32

So, Ali has $32 left after buying dinner.

answer:  To determine the total number of animals at the farm and zoo combined, we need to calculate the number of cows and sheep at each location and then sum them up.

1. **Number of cows at the zoo:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
   - Therefore, the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.

2. **Number of sheep at the farm:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
   - Therefore, the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.

3. **Total number of animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Therefore, the total number of animals at the farm and zoo combined is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \).

So, the farm and zoo have 120 animals combined.

answer:  To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and quantity of each type of wood.

First, let's calculate the number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24:
- Cost per 2 x 4 piece: $4
- Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy: $24 / $4 = 6 pieces
- Total popsicle sticks from 2 x 4 pieces: 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 sticks

Next, let's calculate the number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:
- Cost per 2 x 8 piece: $6
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy: $24 / $6 = 4 pieces
- Total popsicle sticks from 2 x 8 pieces: 4 pieces * 400 sticks/piece = 1600 sticks

Comparing the two options, Frederick can make 1600 popsicle sticks if he buys the 2 x 8 pieces, which are cheaper.

answer:  To determine how much money Gerald has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Gerald earns in a week.
2. Subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings.

First, let's calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week:
- Gerald earns $30 per day.
- He worked for an entire week, which is 7 days.

Total earnings = $30/day * 7 days = $210

Next, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
- Gerald spent $100.

Amount left = $210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.

answer:  First, let's determine how many quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour:

1. Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked by all four:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29 quarts.

answer:  Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

First, solve for \( O \):
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ O = 3 \]

Next, solve for \( P \):
\[ 4P = 4 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ P = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes:
\[ \text{Total} = O + P \]
\[ \text{Total} = 3 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Convert the total distance into kilometers.
3. Calculate the amount of water needed based on the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run:
- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- Hannah is running 8 laps.
- Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
- Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap
- Total distance = 2 km

Next, we convert the total distance into kilometers:
- The total distance is already in kilometers, so no further conversion is needed.

Now, we calculate the amount of water needed based on the total distance:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
- Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
- Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Finally, let's find out how much money she has left after buying the CDs:

\[ \text{Remaining money after CDs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie has $300 left.

answer:  To determine Tara's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags:
- Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each.
- Each pack contains 5 bags, so the total number of bags is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) bags.
- The total cost is \(40 \times 4 = 160\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:
- Tara sold each canvas bag for $8.
- She sold 40 bags, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = 320 - 160 = 160 dollars

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $160.

answer:  First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour

After adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per day * 7 days = 84 kilowatts

After adding the new device:
- Weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per day * 7 days = 98 kilowatts

Now, let's find the difference in weekly consumption:
- Difference: 98 kilowatts - 84 kilowatts = 14 kilowatts

Finally, let's calculate the difference in the weekly electric bill:
- Difference in bill: 14 kilowatts * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $21

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $21.

answer:  To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to sum up the hours spent each week.

1. He spent 4 hours each week for 6 weeks:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. He spent 5 hours each week for 2 weeks:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. He spent 6 hours in one week:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, add up all the hours:
\[
24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours.

- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total skeins for one grandchild = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins for one grandchild by 3:

19 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 57 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool.

Next, subtract the number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves baked:
\[ 200 \text{ loaves} - 132 \text{ loaves} = 68 \text{ loaves} \]

Finally, add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store:
\[ 68 \text{ loaves} + 6 \text{ loaves} = 74 \text{ loaves} \]

Therefore, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left.

\[ \text{Problems completed on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday:

\[ \text{Total problems completed by Tuesday} = 12 + 36 = 48 \]

Now, we find out how many problems are remaining after Tuesday:

\[ \text{Remaining problems after Tuesday} = 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems:

\[ \text{Problems completed on Wednesday} = \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems after Tuesday:

\[ \text{Remaining problems after Wednesday} = 52 - 13 = 39 \]

So, the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson buys 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for red tulips = 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson buys 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for blue tulips = 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 rows (red tulips) + 3 rows (blue tulips) = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. First, we find four times the number of seashells brought by the boys:

\[ 4 \times 600 = 2400 \]

Now, we add this to the total number of seashells brought by the boys:

\[ 600 + 2400 = 3000 \]

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls:

\[ \frac{3000}{10} = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house.

\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs each person has.

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has:
\[ 20 + 22 = 42 \text{ sofas and chairs} \]

Jenna has 20 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has:
\[ 20 + 66 = 86 \text{ sofas and chairs} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:
\[ 42 + 86 = 128 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is:
#### 128.

answer:  To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of raisins available for each recipe.
2. Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with the available raisins.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins are available for each recipe. Since Heather divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide the total amount of raisins by 3:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed per batch:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches} \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made:
\[ 18 \text{ vlogs} + 21 \text{ vlogs} + 15 \text{ vlogs} = 54 \text{ vlogs} \]

Next, subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she needs to make:
\[ 72 \text{ vlogs} - 54 \text{ vlogs} = 18 \text{ vlogs} \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers:**
   \[
   48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
   - 3 times fewer passengers than the number who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
\[ 5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = \$4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
\[ 6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = \$4.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[ \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00 \]

Verna gave $20, so we need to find out how much change she received by subtracting the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, Verna received $7.00 in change.

answer:  First, let's determine James's current age. Since James will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find James's cousin's age in 8 years. In 8 years, James's age will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, James's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James's age. Therefore, James's cousin's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

To find James's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Finally, we calculate the age difference between James and his cousin now:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the age difference between James and his cousin now is 25 years.

\[ \boxed{25} \]

answer:  To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we first need to find the cost of the headphone set.

Given:
- Cost of the CD: $4
- Total amount paid: $48

The cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom hadn't bought the headphone set, he would have spent $48 on the CD alone. The cost of one CD is $4.

To find out how many more CDs he could have bought, we divide the total amount he would have spent by the cost of one CD:
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost of CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs.

answer:  Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick originally had \( 2G \) candies.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies he has now is \( G - 5 \). We are told that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick originally had:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

answer:  To determine the cost of one monitor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the computer.
2. Determine the cost of the printer.
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer.
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent.
5. Divide the remaining amount by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

1. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount spent is $2,400, so the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.
5. The cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

Therefore, one monitor costs \boxed{300}.

answer:  To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the full alphabet twice:**
   - The full alphabet has 26 letters.
   - She writes it twice, so she writes \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet has \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - She writes it once, so she writes \( 13 \times 1 = 13 \) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - She has already written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.
   - She re-writes all 65 letters, so she writes \( 65 \times 2 = 130 \) letters.

Now, we add up all the letters she has written:
\[ 52 + 13 + 130 = 195 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{195}\).

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8, so he now has:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. Therefore, he saved:

\[ 3 \times 13 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this amount to his current total, he now has:

\[ 13 + 39 = 52 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the eldest boy now has $52.

answer:  To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \( 2 \times 31 = 62 \) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:

\[ 31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} \]

Adding these together:

\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

answer:  To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earns from completing 20 tasks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.
- Jairus completed 20 tasks.
- Jairus's total earnings = $0.8/task × 20 tasks = $<<0.8*20=16>>16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.
- Jenny completed 20 tasks.
- Jenny's total earnings = $0.5/task × 20 tasks = $<<0.5*20=10>>10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's total earnings = $16
- Jenny's total earnings = $10
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $<<16-10=6>>6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator: 1 * $12 = $12
- One geometry set: 1 * $10 = $10

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Next, let's calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money they are dividing together is $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find the value of \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

1. **First Round:**
   - Ali calls 3 families.
   - Total notifications in the first round: 3

2. **Second Round:**
   - Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families.
   - Total notifications in the second round: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \)

3. **Third Round:**
   - Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families.
   - Total notifications in the third round: \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \)

4. **Fourth Round:**
   - Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families.
   - Total notifications in the fourth round: \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \)

Therefore, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

answer:  April has 30 days, so the first half of April is 15 days, and the second half is 15 days.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half, we first need to determine the total amount he needs to save in the second half. Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half, let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the second half will be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 30x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{30} = 37.50 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $37.50 each day in the second half of April to reach his $1125.

answer:  When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Therefore, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we first calculate the total time for each scenario.

On a cold day:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a hot day:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes per mile} = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between the hot day and the cold day is:
\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Ray takes 54 minutes.

answer:  To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the distance Jeff walks each day:**
   - Jeff's work is 3 miles away.
   - He walks to work and back each day.
   - Therefore, the total distance he walks each day is:
     \[
     3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance Jeff walks in a week:**
   - Jeff works 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total distance he walks in a week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

answer:  To calculate Antonella's commission, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: the commission on the first $1000 in sales and the commission on the remaining $1500 in sales.

1. Commission on the first $1000 in sales:
   - The commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission on the first $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. Commission on the remaining $1500 in sales:
   - The commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission on the remaining $1500 = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. Total commission:
   - Total commission = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the remaining $1500
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 for selling goods worth $2500.

answer:  To determine the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider both the initial angle of the pyramid and the rate at which the sun is moving upward.

1. **Initial Angle of the Pyramid:**
   The pyramid sits at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Sun Movement:**
   The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time of Movement:**
   The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Increase in Angle:**
   The total increase in angle due to the sun's movement is:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Total Angle from the Ground to the Sun:**
   To find the total angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the total increase:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

answer:  To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of toys Jonathan needs to make a play set five times larger than James's play set.
2. Calculate how many more toys Jonathan needs to reach this total.
3. Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Jonathan needs to make a play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times larger would be:
\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \]

Next, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

\[ \boxed 398 \]

answer:  To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today is $160.

answer:  Let's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \).

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old} \]

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

answer:  To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters per cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ guinea pigs per cage} = 15 \text{ guinea pigs}
  \]

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
\[
30 \text{ hamsters} + 15 \text{ guinea pigs} = 45 \text{ rodents}
\]

Therefore, the pet shop has 45 rodents.

answer:  First, we need to determine the daily recommended cups of coffee. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks:
\[ \frac{R}{2} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks:
\[ 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 5R = R \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 4 \]

So, the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4 cups.

Juan drinks:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups he needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended intake from his current intake:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 16 \) cups.

answer:  To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has.
2. Calculate the total number of water bottles needed for the party.
3. Find the difference between the bottles needed and the bottles Bill currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has:
- Bill has 2 cases of water.
- Each case contains 24 bottles.
- Total bottles currently = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.

Next, let's calculate the total number of water bottles needed for the party:
- Bill has 70 guests.
- Each guest will have 2 bottles.
- Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.

Finally, let's find the difference between the bottles needed and the bottles Bill currently has:
- Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Total bottles currently
- Additional bottles needed = 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

answer:  Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Therefore, he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 per day * 3 days = $30 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he can buy $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week, he spends $10 per day * 4 days = $40 on plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 6 wooden action figures + 20 plastic action figures = 26 action figures by the end of the week.

- Buttons with four holes: 21 - 7 = 14

Next, calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes:

- Buttons with two holes: 7
- Holes per button with two holes: 2
- Total holes from buttons with two holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Then, calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes:

- Buttons with four holes: 14
- Holes per button with four holes: 4
- Total holes from buttons with four holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Finally, add the total holes from both types of buttons to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:

- Total holes: 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

answer:  To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles needed for each son.
2. Determine the total number of candles needed.
3. Calculate the number of packs required.
4. Compute the total cost.

1. The older son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, he needs 8 candles.
3. The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.
4. Each pack contains 5 candles. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
   \]
5. Each pack costs $3. Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The total amount spent on candles is $12.

answer:  To determine the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to find out how many goals each person scored and then sum them up.

1. **Richie's goals:**
   Richie scored 80 goals.

2. **Mark's goals:**
   Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, Mark scored:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Anna's goals:**
   Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, Anna scored:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

4. **Total goals:**
   Adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
   \[
   \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
   \]

Therefore, all three teenagers scored a total of 175 goals.

answer:  To determine the net profit, we need to calculate both the total revenue and the total costs.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
- Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the total costs:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, they need 1 loaf for 10 sandwiches.
- Total cost of bread = 1 loaf * $3.00/loaf = $3.00
- The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
- Total cost of cheeses and condiments = $30.00

Total costs = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

answer:  To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine their weights.

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs:
   \[
   150 \text{ pounds} - 20 \text{ pounds} = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs:
   \[
   2 \times 130 \text{ pounds} = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add their weights together:
\[
150 \text{ pounds} + 130 \text{ pounds} + 260 \text{ pounds} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[
\frac{540 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob is 180 pounds.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to sum up the amounts received for each group of teeth lost.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each:
   \[
   3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, she received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received:
   \[
   \frac{\$1.00}{2} = \$0.50
   \]
   for each of the last two teeth. Therefore:
   \[
   2 \times \$0.50 = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: The starting value is 20.

2. **Half of the Starting Value**: 
   \[
   \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Adding the Starting Value and Half the Starting Value**:
   \[
   \text{Starting value plus half the starting value} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Dividing by 5**:
   \[
   \text{Result after division} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

5. **Multiplying by the Starting Value**:
   \[
   \text{Result after multiplication} = 6 \times 20 = 120
   \]

6. **Subtracting 12**:
   \[
   \text{Final value} = 120 - 12 = 108
   \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 108.

answer:  To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops per week.
3. Determine the difference between the number of roses Ford grows and the number of roses ordered.
4. Multiply the weekly difference by 4 (assuming a month has 4 weeks) to find the monthly difference.

1. Ford grows 40 roses every week.
2. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.
3. The difference between the number of roses Ford grows and the number of roses ordered per week is 65 - 40 = 25 roses.
4. Multiply the weekly difference by 4 to find the monthly difference: 25 * 4 = 100.

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses every month.

answer:  To determine how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor and then subtract these from the total number of sandwiches.

First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate:
Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches.
\[ \text{Cody's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate:
Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches.
\[ \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:
\[ \text{Total sandwiches eaten} = \text{Cody's sandwiches} + \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:
\[ \text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left.

answer:  To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up all the individual expenses:

1. Spaying the kitten: $200
2. Vaccines: 3 vaccines at $20 each, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\)
3. Broken vases: 4 vases at $12 each, so \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Now, add these amounts together:

\[ 200 + 60 + 48 = 308 \]

So, the total cost of the kitten so far is $308.

answer:  To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house and then subtract that amount from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800
   \]

2. Subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200
   \]

3. Add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house to find the combined value:
   \[
   \text{Combined value} = \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200
   \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200.

answer:  First, calculate the area of Michael's bedroom: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, calculate the cost of the new carpet: $12 per square foot * 216 square feet = $2592.

Then, calculate the cost of the padding: $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432.

Now, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet: $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864.

Finally, calculate the cost of installing the new carpet: $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7764.

Add all these costs together to find the total cost of replacing the carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7764 = $11652.

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11652.

answer:  To determine how much money Kate can make from selling her crayon muffins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small pieces of crayons Kate has.
2. Determine how many muffins she can make.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins.

First, let's find the total number of small pieces of crayons:
- Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each.
- Total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.

Next, we need to determine how many muffins she can make:
- Each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons.
- Number of muffins = Total crayons / Crayons per muffin = 192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins:
- Each muffin is sold for $1.50.
- Total revenue = Number of muffins * Price per muffin = 24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.

Therefore, Kate can make $36 from selling the muffins.

answer:  First, calculate the total calories burned during each activity:
- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Next, find the total calories burned:
- Total calories = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, determine how many 200-calorie segments are in 1600 calories:
- Number of 200-calorie segments = 1600 calories / 200 calories/segment = 8 segments

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, multiply the number of segments by 100 ml:
- Total water needed = 8 segments * 100 ml/segment = 800 ml

answer:  First, determine how many cards the boy's brother has. Since the boy has 5 cards and his brother has 3 fewer cards, you subtract 3 from 5:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the boy's brother has 2 cards.

Next, add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has to find the total number of cards they have together:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the boy and his brother have 7 cards together.

answer:  To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes in 2 years.
2. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the savings account.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Katina removes in 2 years:

- Katina removes $100 every month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, in 2 years, there are \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.
- The total amount removed in 2 years is \( 100 \times 24 = 2400 \) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the savings account:

- The initial amount in the savings account is $3000.
- The remaining amount after 2 years is \( 3000 - 2400 = 600 \) dollars.

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have **$600** remaining in her savings account.

answer:  First, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. When she sets it to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

To find the percentage off, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4%.

Next, we need to find the actual temperature when she sets it to 520 degrees. The actual temperature will be:

\[ \text{Actual temperature} = 520 - \left( \frac{4}{100} \times 520 \right) \]

\[ \text{Actual temperature} = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees.

answer:  Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 64 dishes.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy is 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.
The total number of utensils brought by her friend is 40 cups + 64 dishes = 104 utensils.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend is 36 + 104 = 140 utensils.

answer:  To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the number of birds he saw each day:
- Day 1: 50 birds
- Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4: 120 birds
- Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 470 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:
- Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 470 birds / 7 days = 70 birds per day

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 70 birds per day over the week.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people invited via email and their friends:

- Alex invites 100 people via email.
- Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of friends invited is \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \).

So, the total number of people invited via email and their friends is:
\[ 100 + 200 = 300 \]

Next, let's add the friends and their spouses:

- Alex invites 10 friends.
- Each of these 10 friends brings 1 spouse.
- Therefore, the total number of spouses invited is \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \).

So, the total number of people invited by the friends and their spouses is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Now, let's add all the people together:
\[ 300 + 20 = 320 \]

Therefore, Alex will need a total of 320 seats.

answer:  First, calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. Each box costs $100.00 and is currently 10% off.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$100.00 \times 0.10 = \$10.00 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \$100.00 - \$10.00 = \$90.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts.

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 2 \times \$90.00 = \$180.00 \]

Now, determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.

\[ \text{Total contacts} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Finally, calculate the cost per pair of contacts.

\[ \text{Cost per pair} = \frac{\$180.00}{180} = \$1.00 \]

So, each pair of contacts will cost $1.00.

answer:  Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3.00B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3.00} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).

Therefore, there are \( 30 \) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the duration of each movie into minutes:

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 30 minutes = 30 minutes
   - Total for the first movie = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
   - 5 minutes = 5 minutes
   - Total for the second movie = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of both movies together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie)
- Total time = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

answer:  To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake.

First, let's find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:

- A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.

The amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 200 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake:

\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week.

answer:  To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weight of each dog step by step.

1. **Affenpinscher:**
   - The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund:**
   - The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   - Therefore, the Dachshund's weight is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) pounds.

3. **Papillon:**
   - The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   - Therefore, the Papillon's weight is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pounds.

4. **Mastiff:**
   - The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   - Therefore, the Mastiff's weight is \( 44 \times 5 = 220 \) pounds.

So, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{220}
\]

answer:  To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial typing speed.
2. Calculate the new typing speed after the first increase.
3. Calculate the new typing speed after the second increase.
4. Sum the three measurements.
5. Divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. New typing speed after the first increase: 52 WPM
3. New typing speed after the second increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, sum the three measurements:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

Finally, divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

answer:  To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

1. 8 quarters: \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) cents
2. 6 dimes: \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \) cents
3. 14 nickels: \( 14 \times 5 = 70 \) cents
4. 15 pennies: \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) cents

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Colby has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[ \frac{345 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents per gumball}} = 69 \text{ gumballs} \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

answer:  Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2(J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

answer:  To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost on Amazon.com:
- Cost of the boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon.com: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost on eBay:
- Cost of the boots: $13
- Shipping cost on Amazon: $4
- Shipping cost on eBay: 2 * $4 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.com:
- Difference in cost: $21 - $20 = $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon.com.

answer:  To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over 5 weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will lose \( 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, he will gain \( 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is 2 pounds.

answer:  To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to find the plane's speed.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{2000}{400} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

answer:  To find the total number of legs for all the pets in the store, we need to consider the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. Dogs have 4 legs each.
2. Cats have 4 legs each.
3. Birds have 2 legs each.

Let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = <<5*4=20>>20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = <<2*4=8>>8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = <<10*2=20>>20 legs

Now, let's add up all the legs:

- Total legs = 20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds)
- Total legs = 20 + 8 + 20 = <<20+8+20=48>>48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs for all the pets in the store is 48.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

1. Each implant costs $2000, and George needs 2 implants:
   \[
   2 \times 2000 = 4000
   \]

2. One of the implants costs an extra $500 for the crown:
   \[
   4000 + 500 = 4500
   \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600:
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900
   \]

So, George needs to earn $3900 to pay for the dental work.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the total amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage:

\[
\frac{3900}{15} = 260
\]

Therefore, George needs to work an additional 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

answer:  First, let's determine how many rotations the tires undergo in one year.

Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, so in one year (12 months), he drives:
\[ 400 \text{ miles/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 4800 \text{ miles/year} \]

For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, in 4800 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ 4800 \text{ miles} \times 725 \text{ rotations/2 miles} = 2900000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Each tire can withstand 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many years the tire will last, we divide the total rotations by the rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10440000 \text{ rotations}}{2900000 \text{ rotations/year}} \approx 3 \text{ years} \]

So, the tire will last for approximately 3 years before it needs to be replaced.

answer:  Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, in one hour, Ruiz can make 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds of chocolates.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds of chocolates in one hour.

Together, in one hour, Ruiz and Marissa can make 60 pounds + 90 pounds = 150 pounds of chocolates.

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

150 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1800 pounds

answer:  To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the total cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,460.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- Difference in cost = $95,460 - $29,100 = $66,360.

Therefore, it costs $66,360 more to repave Lewis' street than to repave Monica's street.

answer:  Let the smallest angle in the triangle be \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

Now, we can find the measures of the other angles:
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is the third angle, which is 90 degrees.

answer:  To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new weight after a 50% increase from the original 8-pound weight.
2. Adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the new weight since it was too heavy.

First, let's calculate the new weight after a 50% increase:

\[ \text{Original weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } 8 \text{ pounds} = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{New weight} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the new weight:

\[ \text{Final weight} = 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

answer:  To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water for the year.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used per week:
- Gary does laundry twice a week.
- Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- Total water used per week = 2 loads/week * 20 gallons/load = 40 gallons/week.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total water used per year = 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the water for the year:
- Each gallon of water costs $0.15.
- Total cost = 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

answer:  To determine the cost per pump, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle.
2. Determine the cost per pump.
3. Convert the cost per pump to cents.

First, let's find the total number of pumps in the bottle:
- The directions say to use 2 pumps for 120 washings.
- If Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, she will need 120 pumps.

Next, we calculate the cost per pump:
- The total cost of the bottle is $24.00.
- There are 120 pumps in the bottle.
- Therefore, the cost per pump is \( \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \) dollars.

Finally, we convert the cost per pump to cents:
- Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, 0.20 dollars is equal to \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) cents.

So, each pump of shampoo will cost 20 cents.

answer:  Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday and receives 5 games for Christmas, so he has 5 + 5 = 10 games.

In the first year, he buys 1 game per month, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 10 + 12 + 5 = 27 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 27 + 24 + 5 = 56 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 56 + 48 + 5 = 109 games.

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has 109 games.

answer:  To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends over the three days and then subtract that from his original amount.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the amounts spent over the three days:
\[
8 \text{ (Monday)} + 16 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 64 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[
100 \text{ dollars} - 88 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Howard has \boxed{12} left.

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we find the number of remaining seats after the administrators are seated:
\[ 72 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Then, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, the rest of the seats are occupied by the students:
\[ 54 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 36 \text{ seats} \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

answer:  John received initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. His research took 10 times that long, so it took 10 * 5 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, he received $100,000 per month, so that's 5 * $100,000 = $500,000.

For the remaining 45 months, he received 50% more funding per month. This means he received $100,000 + (50% of $100,000) = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

So, for the remaining 45 months, he received 45 * $150,000 = $6750,000.

In total, his research cost $500,000 + $6750,000 = $7250,000.

\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:

Patrick sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours at $0.60 per cup.
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Patrick earned $72 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after school, Jim has:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 4 \text{ pieces} = 16 \text{ pieces} \]

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
\[ 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

After this, Jim has:
\[ 16 \text{ pieces} - 2 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

\[ \text{Discounted price of the shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's add the cost of the shorts to the discounted price of the shirt. The cost of the shorts is $35.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Now, let's determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. Joe started with $50.

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Joe will not have enough money to buy the shirt and shorts. He will be short by $2.50.

Therefore, Joe will be short by $2.50.

answer:  Scarlett bought an aquarium for $10.00.
She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each, so 2 * $2.50 = $<<2*2.50=5.00>>5.00 for rocks.
She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, so 3 * $2.00 = $<<3*2.00=6.00>>6.00 for coral.
She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, so 20 * $0.50 = $<<20*0.50=10.00>>10.00 for fish.
She needed fish food that cost $2.00.
Adding up all these costs, Scarlett spent $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $<<10.00+5.00+6.00+10.00+2.00=33.00>>33.00.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen croissants:**
   - It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.

2. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants:**
   - Since it takes 1/4 pound for 1 dozen, for 4 dozen it will be:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for a week:**
   - Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for a week is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

answer:  To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection:
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections:
- There are 4 intersections.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights for all intersections is \( 24 \times 4 = 96 \).

Finally, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:
- There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
- Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is \( 96 - 20 = 76 \).

answer:  To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per hour (Mb/hour), we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).
2. Convert megabytes per second (Mb/s) to megabytes per hour (Mb/hour).

First, we know that:
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

So, to convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s:
\[ 20 \text{ kb/s} \times \frac{1 \text{ Mb}}{1000 \text{ kb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to convert Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/hour} = 7.2 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in megabytes per hour is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, with each beef tip being 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate 8 ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, which do not contain meat. Therefore, they do not contribute to the total meat consumption.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat eaten by the first three players:

- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

Total = 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

Since the fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, they do not contribute to the total amount of meat consumed by the team.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts made by one member in March.
3. Calculate the total number of posts made by all members in March.

1. March has 31 days.
2. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Therefore, the total number of posts made by one member in March is:
   \[
   3 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93 \text{ posts/member}
   \]
3. There are 1000 members in the group. Therefore, the total number of posts made by all members in March is:
   \[
   93 \text{ posts/member} \times 1000 \text{ members} = 93,000 \text{ posts}
   \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.

So, the total amount of meat sold in one day is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \text{ kg}}{150 \text{ kg/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of cars towed in the first three days:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, determine the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days. Since the truck towed four fewer cars each day than the first three days, we calculate:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, calculate the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to find the total number of cars towed in the week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]

answer:  First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4} = \$1.30 \]

The cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 apples is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30 = \$6.50 \]

The cost of 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50 \]

Finally, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

answer:  To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play count for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. **DVD 1:**
   - Total play count: 1000 times
   - Plays already played: 356 times
   - Remaining play count: 1000 - 356 = 644 times

2. **DVD 2:**
   - Total play count: 1000 times
   - Plays already played: 135 times
   - Remaining play count: 1000 - 135 = 865 times

Now, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
- Remaining play count for DVD 1: 644 times
- Remaining play count for DVD 2: 865 times

Total remaining play count: 644 + 865 = 1509 times

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509 times.

Answer: \( \boxed{1509} \).

answer:  To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each jewel and then sum them up.

1. The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell. Therefore, the price of a gold Jewell is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. Therefore, the price of a silver Jewell is:
   \[
   1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum up the prices of all three jewels:
\[
2000 \text{ (diamond)} + 1600 \text{ (gold)} + 1200 \text{ (silver)} = 4800
\]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4,800.

answer:  To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of physical therapy sessions.
2. Calculate the total number of hours of physical therapy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the cost per hour.

1. Total number of physical therapy sessions:
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he went twice, so there are 2 sessions per week.
   - Therefore, the total number of sessions is 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions.

2. Total number of hours of physical therapy:
   - Each session lasts 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours is 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

3. Total cost of the physical therapy:
   - The cost per hour is $125.
   - Therefore, the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3,000.

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3,000.

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height Adam needs to grow.
3. Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow that additional height.

1. Convert the required height from feet to inches:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Calculate the additional height Adam needs to grow:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches at a rate of 2 inches per year:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

answer:  To find the total distance Alisa and Stanley biked, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then sum those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance biked by Alisa = Speed × Time
Distance biked by Alisa = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance biked by Stanley = Speed × Time
Distance biked by Stanley = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

answer:  To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class he can afford without exceeding $10.

First, let's find the total cost if he attends all 10 classes:
\[ 10 \text{ classes} \times \$10 \text{ per class} = \$100 \]

Manny initially signed up for $60, so the remaining amount he can spend on additional classes is:
\[ \$100 - \$60 = \$40 \]

Since he can't spend more than $10 per class, the maximum number of additional classes he can afford is:
\[ \frac{\$40}{\$10 \text{ per class}} = 4 \text{ classes} \]

Therefore, Manny can afford a maximum of 4 additional classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

If he attends all 10 classes, he can miss:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ classes} \]

So, Manny can miss 6 classes before his parents don't sign him up again.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total selling price of the cars:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \text{ per car} = \$250,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the amount the company paid to acquire the cars:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total profit by subtracting the amount paid from the total selling price:
\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

answer:  To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps:**
   - Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

2. **Truck Stamps:**
   - Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
   - Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
   - Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   - Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
   - Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
   - Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10

Now, we add up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps:
- Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
- Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
- Total number of stamps = 45

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.

\boxed{45}

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{Volume} \times \text{Time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \times 3 \text{ seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid on Tuesday:
- She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is 20 * $20 = $400.
- She received a $2 discount, so her final cost is $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid on Wednesday:
- She bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the initial cost is 20 * $30 = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount, so the discount amount is $600 * 0.10 = $60.
- Her final cost after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
- Clara's final cost is $398.
- Sheila's final cost is $540.
- The difference is $540 - $398 = $142.

answer:  To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them.

First, let's find the relative speed between Tom and Bob:
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap at a relative speed of 15 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

answer:  To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the first website:
- The first website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles published by the first website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the sister company:
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles published by the sister company = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Finally, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
- Total articles published by both websites = 560 articles (first website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles.

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840.

answer:  To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to calculate their daily production rates and then extend that to a weekly basis.

1. **Jewel's daily production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Julie's daily production:**
   - Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

3. **Combined daily production:**
   - Combined daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
   - Combined daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

4. **Total weekly production:**
   - They work all days of the week, which is 7 days.
   - Total weekly production = Combined daily production \(\times\) Number of days in a week
   - Total weekly production = 150 customers/day \(\times\) 7 days = 1050 customers per week.

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers per week.

#### 1050 customers per week.

answer:  To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine the total number of whole eggs required.
3. Convert the total number of whole eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

Next, we know that 1 whole egg is required to make 2 deviled egg halves. Therefore, the total number of whole eggs needed is:
- Total whole eggs = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

Finally, we convert the total number of whole eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
- Total dozens = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

answer:  Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as \( L \) miles.

According to the problem:
- Paisley ran 4 miles.
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.
- Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran \( L + 3 \) miles.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ 20 - 3 = L \]
\[ L = 17 \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

answer:  To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \)
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \)
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, add all these costs together:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 43,500 \]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

answer:  First, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at 4 feet per hour through soil and needs to dig 24 feet.

\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the speed of soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay and needs to dig 8 feet.

\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add the time for digging through the soil and the time for digging through the clay to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for soil} + \text{Time for clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Bill a total of 10 hours to dig the well.

answer:  To determine the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to calculate the cooking time for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Rice**: It took her 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. **Pork**: It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for rice and pork is:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all three items:
\[
30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes.

   \text{Wife's age} = \text{Steve's age} + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. **Son's Age**: Their son is currently half as old as his mom.
   \[
   \text{Son's age} = \frac{\text{Wife's age}}{2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. **Son's Wife's Age**: Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.
   \[
   \text{Son's wife's age} = \text{Son's age} - 3 = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

answer:  First, let's calculate the 5% raise on Tim's $20,000 monthly salary:

\[ \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, he receives a bonus worth half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

Therefore, his total monthly income is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.

1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each:
   \[
   2 \times 2.00 = 4.00
   \]

2. Gus bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00:
   \[
   8.00
   \]

3. Gus bought a bottle of soda for $1.00:
   \[
   1.00
   \]

Now, let's add up the costs of these items:
\[
4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[
7.00
\]

answer:  First, let's determine the sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400 and this was half the sales from green hats, we can calculate the sales from green hats as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total sales for the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount made in two months:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags.

First, let's find the total amount of flour in one bag:
- Each bag is divided into 8 portions.
- Each portion weighs 2 kilograms.

So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags:
- There are 3 bags.

So, the total amount of flour in three bags is:
\[ 16 \text{ kg/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[ 48 \text{ kg} \]

The final answer is 48 kilograms.

answer:  To determine how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes required for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- Howie: 1 person
- His teacher: 1 person
- Classmates: 25 people

Total number of people = 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people

Each person will get 2 cupcakes. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

answer:  First, determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has 3/4 times as much as Aurelia:
\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy:
\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

Finally, divide the total amount of money equally among the three:
\[ \text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120 if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

answer:  Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

First, calculate the number of pages she has written:
\[ \text{Pages written} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

Next, subtract the number of pages she has written from the total number of pages:
\[ \text{Pages left} = 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

answer:  To determine the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of likes after the first week.
2. Calculate the number of likes after three weeks.
3. Add the recent new likes.

1. **Initial number of likes:**
   Fishio received 2000 likes after the first week.

2. **Number of likes after three weeks:**
   Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
   \[
   \text{Number of likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Total number of likes after recent new likes:**
   Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently.
   \[
   \text{Total number of likes} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 160,000.

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. There are 3 people, so we divide 12 pounds by 3:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} \div 3 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, each person would have 4 pounds of candy.

answer:  First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost for the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost for the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

Difference in cost = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, it costs $3 more for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than for the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

answer:  James hires the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for the remaining 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the cost of the first hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each hour:
1. First hour: $15
2. Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
3. Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60
4. Fourth hour: $60 * 2 = $120

Now, let's add up the costs for the 3 hours:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Total cost for the first 3 hours = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

Now, let's add the cost of the fourth hour:
- Fourth hour: $120

Total cost for 4 hours = $105 + $120 = $225

answer:  To determine how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.
2. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A.
3. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District C.
4. The remaining number will be the number of newspapers delivered to District B.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total newspapers delivered in a day: 600
2. Newspapers delivered to District A: 198
3. Newspapers delivered to District C: 209

First, subtract the newspapers delivered to District A from the total:
\[ 600 - 198 = 402 \]

Next, subtract the newspapers delivered to District C from the result:
\[ 402 - 209 = 193 \]

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

answer:  First, we need to convert the height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The difference in height needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

1. Calculate the total number of pages in the book.
2. Determine how many days it will take Mike to read the book.
3. Subtract the number of days it will take from the deadline.

1. The total number of pages in the book is 200.
2. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]
3. The deadline is 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish, we subtract the number of days it takes from the deadline:
   \[
   30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

answer:  To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Determine the difference between the total amount received and her weekly wage.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week:

- Sally's bank account started with $200 and ended with $420.
- The increase in her bank account is:
  \[
  420 - 200 = 220
  \]

So, Sally received $220 this week.

Next, we compare this amount to her weekly wage:

- Sally's weekly wage should be $300.
- The difference between the amount she received and her weekly wage is:
  \[
  300 - 220 = 80
  \]

Therefore, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

answer:  Let \( S \) be the number of sheep and \( G \) be the number of geese.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of animal legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)
2. The total number of animal heads: \( S + G = 20 \)

First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Thus, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

answer:  To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for renting the hanger and fuel.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly cost of renting the hanger: $5000
3. Monthly cost of fuel: 2 * $5000 = $10,000

First, let's calculate the total monthly cost:
- Monthly cost = $5000 (hanger) + $10000 (fuel) = $15,000

Next, let's calculate the total annual cost:
- Annual cost = $15,000/month * 12 months = $180,000

Finally, let's add the initial cost of the plane to the annual cost:
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

Therefore, the cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

The cost of type A candies is:
\[ 7 \text{ candies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per candy} = \$3.50 \]

The cost of type B candies is:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.75 \text{ per candy} = \$7.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$3.50 + \$7.50 = \$11.00 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he received is:
\[ \$15.00 - \$11.00 = \$4.00 \]

answer:  Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

First, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, the new length of the dress after the extension is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Next, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. So, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

\( \boxed{80} \)

Next, calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class over 6 weeks:

Since John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, divide the total hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:

\[ 48 \text{ hours} \div 1.5 \text{ hours/recipe} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes.

answer:  First, determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more:

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound per day and there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the coffee:

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  To determine how many cookies are in the box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes.
2. Find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda.
3. Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked.

First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda bakes:
- Greta bakes 30 cookies.
- Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta.
- Therefore, Celinda bakes \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:
- Greta's cookies: 30
- Celinda's cookies: 60
- Total cookies baked: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \)

Finally, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked:

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of management employees in the company. Since 20% of the employees are management, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3.

answer:  James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so there are a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Each dog needs one toy, so James initially needs 12 toys.

After buying the toys, James goes back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 12 dogs when he left, twice as many more dogs means 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

So, there are now 12 + 24 = 36 dogs in the shelter.

Each dog needs one toy, so James needs to buy 36 more toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are now 36 - 3 = 33 dogs in the shelter.

Each dog needs one toy, so James needs to buy 33 more toys.

In total, James needs 12 + 36 + 33 = 81 toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of <<12+36+33=81>>81 toys.

answer:  First, determine the number of history teachers on the court. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Next, find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each sleeps:

\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.

answer:  Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in one year, he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which means he saves 20 + (2/5) * 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.
In one year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.
Over ten years, Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
Over ten years, Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.
Together, Rong and Neil have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

answer:  To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we can use the given information that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:
\[ \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

answer:  To determine how many good days Christina has left in the month, we need to account for the distribution of her moods over the days.

1. **First 8 Days:**
   - All days were good.

2. **Next 8 Days:**
   - All days were bad.

3. **Next 8 Days:**
   - All days were neutral.

4. **Next 3 Days:**
   - One day was good.
   - One day was neutral.
   - One day was good.

Now, let's add up the good days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 8 days: 0 good days
- Next 8 days: 0 good days
- Next 3 days: 2 good days

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 10 \]

Christina had 10 good days out of the 30 days in the month. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

**Answer:** 20 good days

answer:  To determine the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = Flour + Sugar + Salt
Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 tablespoons + 3 tablespoons + 0.25 tablespoons
Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, to find the total dry ingredients for 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = Total dry ingredients for one muffin * 16
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 8.25 tablespoons * 16
Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

answer:  To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has and then compare it to the total number of people attending the function.

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   - Mia has 8 high chairs.
   - She has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**
   - Mia has 8 high chairs.
   - She has 40 regular chairs.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs is \( 8 + 40 = 48 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of people attending the function:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \( 42 + 15 = 57 \).

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - Mia needs \( 57 - 48 = 9 \) more chairs.

answer:  To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time spent in each mode and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent in turtle mode:**
   - Chris mows half of the lawn in turtle mode.
   - He mows the entire lawn in turtle mode in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, it takes him 60 minutes to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode.

2. **Time spent in rabbit mode:**
   - Chris mows half of the lawn in rabbit mode.
   - He mows the entire lawn in rabbit mode in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, it takes him 40 minutes to mow half of the lawn in rabbit mode.

3. **Total time spent:**
   - Time spent in turtle mode: 60 minutes
   - Time spent in rabbit mode: 40 minutes
   - Total time: 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 100 minutes.

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 into her retirement account:

\[ 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, let's calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 for her car payment:

\[ 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, let's subtract the amounts put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, after funding her retirement and paying for her car, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

answer:  Let's denote the age of one triplet as \( x \).

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is \( x + 7 \).

There are three triplets and one set of twins, so the total age of the triplets is \( 3x \) and the total age of the twins is \( 2(x + 7) \).

The combined ages are given as 44:
\[ 3x + 2(x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3x + 2x + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, one triplet is 6 years old.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

answer:  First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Next, add the weight of Jack to the total weight of the adults:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 640 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

answer:  To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Determine the total number of signatures they need to reach their goal.
3. Subtract the current total from the goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

First, let's calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:
- Carol has 20 signatures.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Total current signatures = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach their goal of 100 signatures:
- Goal = 100 signatures
- Current total = 64 signatures

Additional signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them.

answer:  To determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we first need to find out how much Gordy's truck can carry.

Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry:
\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let \( G \) be the capacity of Gary's truck. The equation representing the total capacity is:
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]

To find \( G \), we subtract 8800 from both sides:
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds of gravel.

answer:  Let's start by determining how many cookies each person has based on the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has:
   \[
   73 - 12 = 61 \text{ cookies}
   \]
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:
   \[
   73 + 23 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of cookies each person has:
\[
68 \text{ (Katarina)} + 73 \text{ (Max)} + 61 \text{ (Cookie Monster)} + 96 \text{ (Summer)} = 298 \text{ cookies}
\]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and John needs 2 vaccines:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25.

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 6 \text{ minutes} - 13 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

answer:  To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2 per kilo = $4

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3 per kilo = $6

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

1. Calculate the remaining amount they need to raise.
2. Determine the amount they raise per hour.
3. Calculate the number of hours required to raise the remaining amount.

First, let's find the remaining amount they need to raise:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we know they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:
\[ \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Number of hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has for his homework and then subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's calculate the total time for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, let's convert the total time before dinner from hours to minutes:
- 3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:
- Total time before dinner: 180 minutes
- Total homework time: 80 minutes

Time for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of one candy. Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost for five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

answer:  To determine the price of one crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \]

Therefore, the price for one crate of fruit is \boxed{32}.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:

1. The cost to go picking is $20.
2. The cost per pound of blueberries is $1.5.
3. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost of picking = Cost to go picking + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
Total cost of picking = $65

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:

1. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
2. James needs 30 pounds of blueberries.

Total cost at store = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Total cost at store = $2.5 * 30
Total cost at store = $75

Now, let's find out how much James saved:

Savings = Total cost at store - Total cost of picking
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

So, James saved $10.

answer:  To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Calculate the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all males.
4. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all females.
5. Add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to get the total number of dumplings cooked.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
3. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by all males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.
4. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by all females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.
5. The total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

answer:  To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total area of the comforter:
\[
\text{Total square footage} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

1. Calculate the number of people who receive interviews.
2. Calculate the number of people who receive a job offer.
3. Calculate the number of people who accept the position.

1. **Number of people who receive interviews:**
   - 30% of the 100 people who apply receive interviews.
   - Number of people who receive interviews = \( 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \).

2. **Number of people who receive a job offer:**
   - 20% of the 30 people who receive interviews receive a job offer.
   - Number of people who receive a job offer = \( 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \).

3. **Number of people who accept the position:**
   - A third of the 6 people who receive a job offer accept the position.
   - Number of people who accept the position = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \).

1. Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City.
2. Determine the percentage of water used for industrial purposes.
3. Subtract the percentage of water used for industrial purposes from the total percentage of water used by Colorado City to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. 80% of the water used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes.
3. To find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes, we calculate 80% of 40%:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
   \]
4. Subtract the percentage of water used for industrial purposes from the total percentage of water used by Colorado City:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \( \boxed{8} \).

answer:  To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the total cost of fixing the pothole to the potential damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
1. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
2. Cost of asphalt: 3 buckets × $25/bucket = $75

Total cost of fixing the pothole = $120 + $75 = $<<195=195>>195

Next, let's calculate the potential damage to the car if the pothole doesn't get fixed:
Potential damage to the car = $450

Now, let's subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to the car:
Savings = Potential damage to the car - Total cost of fixing the pothole
Savings = $450 - $195 = $<<450-195=255>>255

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

- The city has 15 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 20 fireworks.
- Total fireworks by the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Next, we need to determine how many fireworks Hannah will see from the city's display:
- Hannah will see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Now, let's add the fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah will set off 3 boxes of fireworks.
- Each box contains 5 fireworks.
- Total fireworks from Hannah's backyard = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Finally, we sum up all the fireworks Hannah will see:
- Total fireworks Hannah will see = Fireworks from the city + Fireworks from her backyard
- Total fireworks Hannah will see = 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people in the group:
- Aiden
- 12 friends
- 7 more friends

Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Next, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks required:
- Each person gets 2 drinks.
- Each person gets 3 snacks.

Total drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Now, let's calculate the cost of the drinks and snacks:
- Each drink costs $2.
- Each snack costs $2.

Total cost of drinks = 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Total cost of snacks = 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Finally, let's find the total cost spent on drinks and snacks:
Total cost = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks
Total cost = $80 + $120 = $200

The group spent $200 on snacks and drinks.

answer:  To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops she buys, she gets 3 scoops in total.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so the cost for 3 scoops is:
\[ 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00, we divide $6.00 by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{4.50} = 1.3333 \]

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 full set of 3 scoops. Therefore, she should buy:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream to get the maximum number of scoops as per the deal with her $6.00.

answer:  First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes from feet to inches. 

Topher's shoes are 8 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches long.

Let \( B \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes:
\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 9B \]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

#### 10 inches.

answer:  First, we need to determine how much money each person gets when they divide $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Gerald's share is 3 parts:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Julia's share is 2 parts:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Gerald gets $60 and Julia gets $40.

Next, Gerald spends $10 on a book. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial share:
\[ \text{Gerald's remaining money} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left after spending $10.

answer:  To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new price per computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers.

First, let's calculate the new price per computer:
- The original price per computer is $700.
- The price increase is 10% of $700.
- 10% of $700 is \( 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \).
- Therefore, the new price per computer is \( 700 + 70 = 770 \).

Next, we calculate the total amount paid:
- The company wants to buy 500 computers.
- The new price per computer is $770.
- So, the total amount paid is \( 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \).

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new price is $385,000.

answer:  First, determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} \]

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} \]

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance is found by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

\[ \boxed{120 \text{ feet}} \]

answer:  Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many packs of gum he needs for 30 days, we first calculate the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Each pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

answer:  First, let's determine the rate at which the factory makes each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Next, we calculate the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts

For vanilla ice cream:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Finally, we add the total amounts of both chocolate and vanilla ice cream:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

answer:  To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many books Steven has.
2. Determine how many books Alice has.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, we know that Clara has 20 books and has two times as many books as Steven. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S = 20 \]
where \( S \) is the number of books Steven has. Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]
So, Alice has 16 books.

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]
So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

answer:  To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial number of chairs.

1. Initial number of normal chairs: 170
2. Initial number of baby chairs: 23
3. Number of normal chairs sent for repair: 20
4. Number of baby chairs sent for repair: 13

First, subtract the number of normal chairs sent for repair from the initial number of normal chairs:
\[ 170 - 20 = 150 \]

Next, subtract the number of baby chairs sent for repair from the initial number of baby chairs:
\[ 23 - 13 = 10 \]

Now, add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
\[ 150 + 10 = 160 \]

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

answer:  To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total bathroom area.
2. Multiply the calculated area by the number of tiles needed per square foot.

First, let's find two-thirds of the total bathroom area:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, the total number of mosaic tiles needed is:
\[ 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

answer:  To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each ingredient and then sum them up.

1. **Calories from eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. **Calories from cheese:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Calories from ham:**
   - John uses 2 ounces of ham.
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, we sum up the calories from all the ingredients:
Total calories = 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256 windows.

Next, let's calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Now, let's determine how many windows Hannah smashes:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed from students' cars = (1/4) * 256 = 64 windows.

- She smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed from teachers' cars = (3/4) * 64 = 48 windows.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112 windows.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, so 6 pencils would cost:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = \$3.00 \]

The cost of one eraser is $0.25, so 8 erasers would cost:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = \$2.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00 \]

If you paid $10, the change you would get is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00 \]

So, you would get $5.00 in change.

answer:  First, determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, each class has:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, calculate the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Now, find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with her arms at her sides:

- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute: 300 + 250 = 550 taps

Next, let's calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with her arms raised:

- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute: 200 + 200 = 400 taps

Now, let's calculate the total number of taps over the 5 minutes:

- Taps with arms at sides: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
- Taps with arms raised: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

Total taps: 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps

Therefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 2450.

answer:  Each pizza has 12 slices, so in total, there are 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Each of the three people ate 2/3 * 12 slices per pizza = 8 slices. So, in total, they ate 3 people * 8 slices per person = 24 slices.

The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Each of the two people ate 3/4 * 12 slices per pizza = 9 slices. So, in total, they ate 2 people * 9 slices per person = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left is 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

answer:  First, calculate the number of votes for candidate A:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, calculate the number of votes for candidate B:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = \text{Votes for candidate A} + 50\% \text{ of } \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20 + 0.50 \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, calculate the total number of votes for candidates A and B:
\[ \text{Total votes for A and B} = \text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Finally, calculate the number of votes for candidate C:
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - \text{Total votes for A and B} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

answer:  To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one week:
- Weekdays: 5 weekdays * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 weekends * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total in one week: 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one month:
- Each month has 4 weeks.
- Total in one month: 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 2000 chairs

Finally, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total in two months: 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.

answer:  To find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat.

So, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the average time by dividing the total time by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

\[ \text{Total spools} = 15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} \]

\[ \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we determine the number of blue spools:

\[ \text{Blue spools} = 15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of blue spools:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars, so she spent 10 * $5 = $50 on gallon jars.
She also bought 16 half-gallon jars, so she spent 16 * $3 = $48 on half-gallon jars.
The total amount of money she spent is $50 + $48 = $98.

answer:  To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to determine the ages of each person and then sum them up.

1. **Dora's age:**
   Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Dora's father's age:**
   Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Dora's mother's age:**
   Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
   \]

4. **Total combined age:**
   Add Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age.
   \[
   \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
   \]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \( 87 \) years.

answer:  Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.
She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.
The rest of her large stickers, which is 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers, she trades for small buttons.
Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 60 small buttons.
In total, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons, 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.
Therefore, she ends up with 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

1. **Initial number of slices:**
   - The plate initially had 2 slices.

2. **Slices added:**
   - Mara added 3 more slices.
   - Total after adding 3 slices: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) slices.

3. **Tripling the slices:**
   - Mara tripled the number of slices.
   - Total after tripling: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) slices.

4. **Slices eaten:**
   - Mara ate 2 slices.
   - Total after eating 2 slices: \( 15 - 2 = 13 \) slices.

5. **Slices stolen:**
   - Her friend stole 5 slices.
   - Total after stealing 5 slices: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.
To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 100 - 87 = 13.

answer:  To find the price of the bag after a 5% discount, you need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 7
   \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 133
   \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133.

answer:  To determine how much money the vendor saves in a week, we need to calculate the cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor and the cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.50.
- Daily cost from the old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.50/tomato = $250.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.40.
- Daily cost from the new vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.40/tomato = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings:
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly savings:
- Weekly savings = $50/day * 7 days/week = $350.

The vendor saves $350 a week.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 small cubes * 1/2 ounce per cube = 4 ounces

Next, let's add up the total amount of water used:

12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After making the ice cubes, he will have:

32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces of water left.

answer:  Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90/2 = $45. 

In total, Jayden has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more to buy the camera.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \).

According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students in the class is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball is 5. Therefore, the number of students who like to either play video games or play music is:
\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

We know that 10 students like to play music, so the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music is:
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ 25 \]

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther initially had 48 bananas.

2. **Bananas stolen by Arnold:**
   Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, the number of bananas left is:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Bananas added by Gunther:**
   Gunther added 25 bananas to the pile:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Bananas stolen by Arnold again:**
   Arnold stole another 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Bananas added by Gunther again:**
   Gunther added another 6 bananas to the pile:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Therefore, Gunther found \(\boxed{43}\) bananas in the pile.

answer:  To determine the number of birds now in the backyard, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of birds Jeremy scared away.
2. Subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds.
3. Add the number of new birds that joined.

First, let's calculate the number of birds Jeremy scared away:
\[ \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds:
\[ \text{Number of birds remaining} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we add the number of new birds that joined:
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

So, the number of birds now in the backyard is 28.

answer:  To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marissa had initially.
2. Subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount to find out how much money she has left.
3. Divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars she can buy.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Marissa initially had $80.
2. She bought a ball for $20, so the remaining amount of money is:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, we divide $60 by $5:
   \[
   60 \div 5 = 12
   \]

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

answer:  To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she needs to groom and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the total number of animals:
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12

   Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

2. Determine the number of days in a week:
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. Divide the total number of animals by the number of days:
   Animals per day = 28 / 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

answer:  To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played each day.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we add these matches together:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \text{ matches} \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

1. Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold.
2. Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- There are 4 vanilla scents available.
- 5 of each vanilla scent was sold.
- Therefore, the total number of vanilla scents sold is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- There are 8 fruity scents available.
- 2 of each fruity scent was sold.
- Therefore, the total number of fruity scents sold is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).

Now, let's find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- The difference is \(20 - 16 = 4\).

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

answer:  Mark buys 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

He gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

He also gets 30 more cards with an average value of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

The total value of all the cards is:
\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the packs from the total value of the cards:
\[ \text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, Mark's profit is:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1100 \]

answer:  To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Carl has.
2. Determine how many marbles Cal has.
3. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we calculate Carl's marbles as follows:
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we calculate Cal's marbles as follows:
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together:
\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a total of 336 marbles combined.

   300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs}
   \]
3. Each song is 10 hours long. Therefore, the total duration of all the songs in the 20 playlists is:
   \[
   6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60,000 hours.

answer:  To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving there and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum:
- Distance to the museum: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Next, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving back home:
- Distance back home: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Now, let's add the total time spent driving:
- Total driving time = Time to the museum + Time back home
- Total driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Finally, let's add the time spent at the museum:
- Total time gone = Total driving time + Time at the museum
- Total time gone = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

answer:  To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of students and the number of students per group.

1. Calculate the number of students per group:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of students if 12 groups are required:
   \[
   \text{Total students for 12 groups} = 12 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ students per group} = 108 \text{ students}
   \]

3. Determine how many more groups are needed:
   \[
   \text{Additional students needed} = 108 \text{ students} - 54 \text{ students} = 54 \text{ students}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{9 \text{ students per group}} = 6 \text{ groups}

answer:  Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed by the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases, and the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed by all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the third house, which needs \( x \) cases, will need 100 cases of shingles.

answer:  To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly electricity bill.
2. Divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates to find the monthly bill per roommate.
3. Multiply the monthly bill per roommate by 12 to find the annual bill per roommate.

First, let's find the total monthly electricity bill:
\[ \text{Total monthly bill} = \$100 \]

Next, we divide the total monthly bill by the number of roommates:
\[ \text{Monthly bill per roommate} = \frac{\$100}{4} = \$25 \]

Finally, we multiply the monthly bill per roommate by 12 to find the annual bill per roommate:
\[ \text{Annual bill per roommate} = \$25 \times 12 = \$300 \]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

answer:  To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum the costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches.
   - Cost per pound: $2.00
   - Total cost for peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00

2. **Plums:**
   - Winston picked 8 pounds of plums.
   - Cost per pound: $1.00
   - Total cost for plums: 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

3. **Apricots:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of apricots.
   - Cost per pound: $3.00
   - Total cost for apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we sum the costs for all the fruits:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

answer:  Let \( x \) represent the number of votes against the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is 33:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen equals \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) glasses.
- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen equals \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) plates.

Next, we need to account for the broken glasses and plates:

- 10 glasses were broken, so the number of intact glasses is \( 96 - 10 = 86 \) glasses.
- 6 plates were broken, so the number of intact plates is \( 48 - 6 = 42 \) plates.

Now, let's find the total number of intact glasses and plates:

- Total intact glasses: 86
- Total intact plates: 42

Therefore, the total number of intact glasses and plates Jeff has now is:

\[ 86 \text{ glasses} + 42 \text{ plates} = 128 \]

answer:  To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Determine the cost of the oranges.

First, let's calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice:

- For 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
- Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:
  \[
  4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg}
  \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the oranges:

- Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
- Therefore, the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
  \[
  20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The answer is:

answer:  To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the days they ride three times a day and the days they ride twice the usual amount.

1. Calculate the number of times they ride three times a day for 5 days:
   \[
   3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ times}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of times they ride twice the usual amount on the other two days:
   \[
   2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
   \]
   \[
   6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times}
   \]

3. Add the totals from both parts:
   \[
   15 \text{ times} + 12 \text{ times} = 27 \text{ times}
   \]

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, determine the number of people remaining after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 people are remaining.

Now, calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]
So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]
So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

   - Number of students = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large shirts:**
   - Number of students = Six more than large shirts
   - Number of students = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up all the shirts:
Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts.

answer:  To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
2. Subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make.
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants:
\[ \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3 \text{ per eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount Bennet wants to make:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Finally, divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
\[ \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3 \text{ per ear} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Finally, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

 Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.

answer:  To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we need to calculate the cost of each item they purchased and then sum these costs.

1. **Leila:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - Each cucumber costs $2.
   - Total cost for cucumbers: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

2. **Jack:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) dollars.

3. **Chase:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce: \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the total costs:
- Total cost for cucumbers: $6
- Total cost for tomatoes: $5
- Total cost for lettuce: $3

Total amount spent: \( 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \) dollars.

Therefore, the three of them spent a total of $14 together.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{9}\), which is \(\frac{9}{2}\):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 6 \times 4.5 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

answer:  To determine how many wheels will be left, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

1. Calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars:
   - Henry has 57 cars.
   - Each car has 4 wheels.
   - Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

2. Calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
   - Henry has 73 motorcycles.
   - Each motorcycle has 2 wheels.
   - Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

3. Calculate the total number of wheels required:
   - Total wheels required = 228 wheels (cars) + 146 wheels (motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

4. Calculate the number of wheels left:
   - Henry has a box with 650 wheels.
   - Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

Therefore, Henry will have 276 wheels left after assembly.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many 9-person groups were formed from the 90 people.

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members who brought back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups had members who brought back 2 seashells each.

\[ \text{Number of groups with 2 seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Each group has 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells.

\[ \text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since there are 6 such groups:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is \( 108 \).

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has.

George has 45% more pears than bananas. He has 200 bananas.

First, calculate 45% of 200:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

Next, add this amount to the number of bananas to find the number of pears:
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Therefore, George has 490 fruits in total.

answer:  To determine the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books read by Ezra.
2. Determine the number of books read by Ahmed.
3. Add the number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

First, let's calculate the number of books read by Ezra:
- Ezra read 300 books initially.
- Ezra then read 150 more books.
- Total books read by Ezra = 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Next, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Let's denote the number of books read by Ahmed as \( A \).
- Therefore, \( 2A = 450 \).
- Solving for \( A \), \( A = \frac{450}{2} = 225 \).

Now, we add the number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:
- Total books read by both = 450 books (Ezra) + 225 books (Ahmed) = 675 books.

1. **Distance driven:**
   - Driving speed: 50 miles per hour
   - Time driven: 4 hours
   - Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 4 hours = 200 miles

2. **Distance hiked:**
   - Hiking speed: 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed
   - Half the driving speed: 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
   - Hiking speed: 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour
   - Time hiked: 1.5 hours
   - Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

3. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 200 miles + 30 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, the Llesis family's vacation spot was 230 miles away.

answer:  First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Base earnings for Monday = 5 hours * $15/hour = $75.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5.
- Total earnings for Monday = $75 + $5 = $80.

Next, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Base earnings for Wednesday = 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.
- Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.
- Total earnings for Wednesday = $30.

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for both days:
- Total earnings for Monday = $80
- Total earnings for Wednesday = $30
- Total earnings for both days = $80 + $30 = $110.

Therefore, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours remaining.
She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours.
Therefore, she has 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours left for soccer.
To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

answer:  Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he received a $0.50 raise, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received an additional $1.00 raise, so his final hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial hourly wage, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

If Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings are $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.

If Sally works 20 hours, her total earnings are $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally.

answer:  Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. After buying the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + y \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + x \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17, so \( x + y = 17 \).

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, substitute \( y = 17 - x \) into the equation:

\[ 3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x) \]
\[ 20 - x = 8 + 2x \]
\[ 12 = 3x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

answer:  To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon.
2. Determine the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Brandon.
3. Calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie.
4. Determine the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Charlie.

First, we calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon:
\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we determine the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Brandon:
\[ \text{Pencils remaining after Brandon} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Then, we calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie:
\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

Finally, we determine the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Charlie:
\[ \text{Pencils remaining after Charlie} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept \(10\) pencils.

answer:  To find the price you have to pay after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at $1000, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount percentage}}{100} \right) \times \text{Original price} \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \times 1000 \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.20 \times 1000 \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 200 \]

Next, subtract the discount amount from the original price:
\[ \text{Final price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} \]
\[ \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 \]
\[ \text{Final price} = 800 \]

The answer is $800

answer:  To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. **Number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

2. **Number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \)

3. **Number of OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the sales are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - 15
   - Number of OLED TVs = 25

Therefore, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

answer:  To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals.

She wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

So Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

answer:  Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in various series, so there are 600/3 = 200 series movies.
A normal movie costs $10, so the cost of the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.
The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.
40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so there are 400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.
Each older movie costs $5, so the cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.
The total cost of replacing all the movies is $1200 + $800 = $2000.

answer:  Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \), the number of berries she collects as \( B \), and the number of seconds left on the timer as \( T \).

Ava's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]

Emma's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is -25 points. This means Ava scores 25 points less than Emma.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   The train starts with 172 people.

2. **First stop:**
   - 47 people get off the train.
   - 13 people get on the train.

   First, subtract the number of people who get off:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]

   Then, add the number of people who get on:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]

   So, after the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.

3. **Second stop:**
   - 38 people get off the train.

   Subtract the number of people who get off:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

   So, after the second stop, there are 100 people on the train.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

answer:  To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the percentage of students who passed in each grade and then find the average of these percentages.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Pass rate = 2 * 40% = 80%

Now, we find the average of these pass rates:
- Average pass rate = (68% + 40% + 80%) / 3
- Average pass rate = 188% / 3
- Average pass rate ≈ 62.67%

The school's overall pass rate is approximately 62.67%.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost $30:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining $4 by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $2.

answer:  To determine how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike paid to find the remaining money.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The original price of the jeans is $40.
   - The discount is 25%.
   - Discount amount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10.

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
   - Sale price = Original price - Discount amount = $40 - $10 = $30.

3. Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike paid to find the remaining money:
   - Mike pays with a $50.00 bill.
   - Remaining money = Amount paid - Sale price = $50 - $30 = $20.

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

answer:  To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work each week.
2. Determine the total amount of gas used per week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gas consumed per week.

1. **Total distance Andy drives to work each week:**
   - One-way distance: 5 miles
   - Two-way distance: 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles
   - Total distance for 5 days (Monday to Friday): 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

2. **Total amount of gas used per week:**
   - Fuel efficiency: 10 miles per gallon (MPG)
   - Total gas used per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

3. **Total cost of the gas consumed per week:**
   - Price of gas: $3 per gallon
   - Total cost per week: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 worth of gas per week.

answer:  To determine how many additional students have joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month from the beginning of the year to the end of May.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we compare the number of students at the end of May to the number of students at the beginning of the year:

\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, by the end of May, 310 additional students would have joined, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

answer:  Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters. She spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- Total value of quarters = 140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- Total value of twenties = 10 twenties * $20/twenty = $200.

Carrie spent all the quarters, so she spent $35 on quarters.

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, so she spent (3/5) * $200 = $120 on twenties.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = Amount spent on quarters + Amount spent on twenties
- Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155.

The answer is $155.

answer:  To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost:
  \[
  3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2/\text{loaf} = \$6
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost:
  \[
  2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1/\text{bagel} = \$2
  \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of 3 loaves bread} - \text{Cost of 2 bagels} = \$6 - \$2 = \$4
\]

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

answer:  To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the temperature at night.
2. Determine the temperature difference needed to keep the house above 32 degrees.
3. Calculate the number of logs required to achieve that temperature difference.

1. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
2. It is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, so the temperature at night is:
   \[
   45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}
   \]
3. The temperature difference needed to keep the house above 32 degrees is:
   \[
   32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees}
   \]
4. Each log heats the house by 5 degrees. Therefore, the number of logs required to heat the house by 20 degrees is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs}
   \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

answer:  Jack uses 1 quarter every 20 minutes, so he uses 1 quarter / 20 minutes = 0.05 quarters per minute.
They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
Two of his friends play half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each.
One of his friends plays 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes.
The total time spent playing is 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.
Since Jack uses 1 quarter every 20 minutes, he uses 840 / 20 = 42 quarters.
The total amount of money used is 42 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $10.50.

answer:  To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of the bottle caps in a 30-day month.

First, let's calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total number of bottle caps he finds in a 30-day month is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of these bottle caps:
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

So, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, she plays for 0.5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 3.5 hours per week.
- Over 2 weeks, she plays for 3.5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 7 hours.

For the next week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, she plays for 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours Kris has played is:
- 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
- 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the video game achievement.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is:

\[ 16 \text{ cars} \]

answer:  To determine how much Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 8 hours and her earnings for the additional 3 hours.

1. **Earnings for the first 8 hours:**
   - Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Earnings for the first 8 hours = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160.

2. **Earnings for the additional 3 hours:**
   - Jamie is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Special hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.50 * $20 = $30 per hour.
   - Earnings for the additional 3 hours = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90.

3. **Total earnings for the day:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings for the first 8 hours + Earnings for the additional 3 hours
   - Total earnings = $160 + $90 = $250.

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on Tuesday.

answer:  To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by 3 to get the total salary for three months.

First, let's find the number of employees after three months:
- Initial number of employees: 200
- New employees hired per month: 20
- Number of employees after three months: 200 + (20 * 3) = 200 + 60 = 260

Next, calculate the total monthly salary for all employees:
- Monthly salary per employee: $4000
- Total monthly salary: 260 * $4000 = $1040,000

Finally, multiply the total monthly salary by 3 to get the total salary for three months:
- Total salary for three months: $1040,000 * 3 = $3120,000

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total number of square inches by the height of the mosaic:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long if he has two bags of glass chips.

answer:  To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time spent on each song and then sum these times.

1. Calculate the time spent on "Deck the Halls":
   - The choir plans to sing "Deck the Halls" twice.
   - Each song is 150 seconds long.
   - Total time for "Deck the Halls" = 2 * 150 seconds/song = 300 seconds.

2. Calculate the time spent on "Jingle Bells":
   - The choir plans to sing "Jingle Bells" once.
   - Each song is 240 seconds long.
   - Total time for "Jingle Bells" = 1 * 240 seconds/song = 240 seconds.

3. Sum the time spent on both songs:
   - Total caroling time = Time for "Deck the Halls" + Total time for "Jingle Bells"
   - Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

answer:  To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day.
2. Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

First, let's find the number of tasks John completes in one day:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Number of tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Next, let's find the number of tasks John completes in one week:
- John works 7 days a week.
- Number of tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days = 1050 tasks/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for the week:
- Each task pays $1.20.
- Total earnings = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260.

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

answer:  To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Nikita scored.
2. Add Pierson's points to Nikita's points.

First, let's calculate Nikita's points:
- Pierson scored 278 points.
- Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.
- Half of Pierson's points is \( \frac{278}{2} = 139 \).
- Adding 11 to 139 gives \( 139 + 11 = 150 \).

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Next, we add Pierson's points to Nikita's points:
- Pierson's points: 278
- Nikita's points: 150
- Total points: \( 278 + 150 = 428 \)

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The answer is:
\[ 428 \]

answer:  To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, let's find the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since he made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total amount made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

Next, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week (which is 7) to find the average number of branches per day:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed \boxed{60} branches per day.

answer:  To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of egg and then sum them up.

1. **Green eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of students and teachers in the school.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and teachers.

Trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree per student = 1000 trees
Trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Total trees planted = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees.

answer:  To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
- Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles per hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
- Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles per hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
- Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
- Difference in distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the distance that separates the two cars will be 20 miles.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of salt used as \( S \) ounces. According to the problem, Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so the amount of sugar used is also \( S \) ounces.

Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil used is \( 2S \) ounces.

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so the amount of fragrance used is also \( S \) ounces.

Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of zest used is \( \frac{S}{2} \) ounces.

The total volume of the salt scrub is the sum of all the ingredients:
\[ S + S + 2S + S + \frac{S}{2} = 5S \]

We know that the total volume of the salt scrub is 10 ounces:
\[ 5S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 2 \]

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is:
\[ 2S = 2 \times 2 = 4 \] ounces.

answer:  To determine the total amount James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold.
2. Add the 30% premium to the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold:
- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of diamond and gold = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to add the 30% premium to the total cost:
- Premium = 30% of $900
- Premium = 0.30 * $900
- Premium = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold:
- Total cost of diamond and gold: $900
- Premium: $270

Total amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring, including the 30% premium fee.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

There are 10 quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon:
\[ 48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 \text{ quarts/gallon} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \]

answer:  To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. Distance traveled in the first segment:
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. Distance traveled in the second segment:
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

3. Total distance traveled:
   - Total distance = Distance of the first segment + Distance of the second segment
   - Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

answer:  To determine how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money raised by the students.
2. Divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

First, let's find the total amount of money raised by the students:
- The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000.
- $50,000 came from organizations.
- Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:
  \[
  175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000
  \]

Next, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:
- There are 20 students.
- The total amount raised by the students is $125,000.
- Therefore, the amount raised by each student is:
  \[
  \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250
  \]

Each student raised \boxed{6250} dollars.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the flowers Rose picked:

1. 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Adding these together:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, we need to account for the fact that Rose dropped 1 flower from each type. Since she dropped 1 flower from each of the 4 types, she dropped a total of 4 flowers.

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
101 petals - (4 flowers * 0 petals/flower) = 101 petals

Therefore, there are 101 petals in total in the vase.

answer:  To determine how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large apples.
2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small apples.
3. Add the slices from the large and small apples.
4. Subtract the number of slices Adam ate from the total number of slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- Total slices from large apples = 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- Total slices from small apples = 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, add the slices from the large and small apples:
- Total slices = 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices:
- Slices left = 30 - 15 = 15 slices left.

answer:  To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of butterscotch candies Dale ordered.
2. Subtract the number of candies he sold.
3. Add the number of candies he ordered later.

Let's go through the calculations:

1. Initial number of butterscotch candies: 100
2. Candies sold: 150
3. Candies ordered later: 100

First, subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number:
\[ 100 - 150 = -50 \]

This means Dale has 50 butterscotch candies left to sell after selling 150.

Next, add the number of candies ordered later:
\[ -50 + 100 = 50 \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

Therefore, the number of butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell is:
\[ 50 + 50 = 50 \]

answer:  First, let's determine how many points Julie scored in the first game. Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha:

\[ \text{Julie's points in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Next, we know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie did in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game:

\[ \text{Sasha's points in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games to find the total:

\[ \text{Sasha's total points} = \text{Sasha's points in the first game} + \text{Sasha's points in the second game} \]
\[ \text{Sasha's total points} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.

1. **Cost of the goats:**
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

2. **Cost of the cows:**
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for goats = $1500
   - Total cost for cows = $3000
   - Total amount spent = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Therefore, John spent $4500 in total.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean:
- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Next, let's account for the marshmallows dropped on the ground:
- They dropped 3 marshmallows.
- Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:
- The bag originally had 35 marshmallows.
- Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Finally, let's determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows:
- Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow.
- Each kid can have 14 S'mores.

Therefore, each kid can have 14 S'mores.

answer:  First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

1. The book weighs 4 pounds.
2. The shipping cost per pound is $0.35.
3. The shipping cost per mile is $0.08.
4. The distance is 20 miles.

Shipping cost = (4 pounds * $0.35/pound) + (20 miles * $0.08/mile)
Shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Shipping cost = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund from Amazon:

1. The book cost $32.
2. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.

Refund = 75% of $32
Refund = 0.75 * $32
Refund = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

Total loss = Shipping cost - Refund
Total loss = $3.00 - $24.00
Total loss = -$21.00

Milly will lose $21.00.

answer:  To find the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the first day.
2. Calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the second day.
3. Add the times from both days to get the total.

First, let's calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the first day:
- Sandy walked for 8 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time Sandy spent walking on the second day:
- Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day.
- Half of 8 hours is 4 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we add the times from both days to get the total:
- 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine the total time available for each group, excluding the intermission:

- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time available for the concert, including the intermission:

- Total show time: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Total available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, let's determine how many groups can perform in the concert:

- Total available time for groups: 110 minutes
- Total time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = Total available time for groups / Total time per group
Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group
Number of groups = 11

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

answer:  To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has.
2. Subtract the number of cupcakes he currently has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's find the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has:
- He has 8 chocolate cupcakes.
- He has 40 toffee cupcakes.

So, the total number of cupcakes he has is:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he currently has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

answer:  To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \( 8 \times 11 = 88 \) tins.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) tins.

Now, we find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- Total tins of cat food: 88
- Total tins of dog food: 36
- Difference: \( 88 - 36 = 52 \)

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

answer:  To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she wants installed and add that to the base installation cost.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela has:
- Mirrors: 6
- Chandeliers: 2
- Pictures: 20

Total additional items = 6 (mirrors) + 2 (chandeliers) + 20 (pictures) = 28 additional items

Next, we calculate the cost of these additional items:
- Cost per additional item = $15.00

Total cost of additional items = 28 additional items * $15.00 per item = $420.00

Finally, we add the cost of the additional items to the base installation cost:
- Base installation cost = $129.00
- Total cost of additional items = $420.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation will be:

answer:  First, determine the number of goats sold from each farm:
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Next, calculate the number of goats left on each farm after the sale:
- Farm X: 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats

Finally, add the number of goats left on both farms to find the total:
- 45 goats (Farm X) + 25 goats (Farm Y) = 70 goats

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

answer:  To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of cars in the parking lot.
2. Add the number of cars counted during the first break.
3. Subtract the number of cars that left before the lunch break.

Let's start with the initial number of cars:
\[ \text{Initial number of cars} = 50 \]

Next, add the number of cars counted during the first break:
\[ \text{Number of cars after first break} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Now, calculate the number of cars that left before the lunch break:
\[ \text{Number of cars that left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35 \]

Finally, subtract the number of cars that left from the number of cars after the first break:
\[ \text{Number of cars during lunch break} = 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]

answer:  To determine how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of money Mulan has.
2. Add the amount her father gave her.
3. Subtract the total cost of the items she bought.

Let's break it down:

1. Mulan initially has $40.
2. Her father gave her $100, so we add that to her initial amount:
   \[
   40 + 100 = 140
   \]
3. Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. The total cost of the jeans is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   Adding the cost of the bag:
   \[
   60 + 20 = 80
   \]
   Subtract this total cost from the amount she has:
   \[
   140 - 80 = 60
   \]

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

answer:  To determine the total number of homes the town will build over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town will build three times as many homes as in the first year.
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36
     \]

3. **Third Year:**
   - The town will double the number of homes built in the first two years.
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is:
     \[
     2 \times (12 + 36) = 2 \times 48 = 96
     \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built each year to find the total:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144
\]

Thus, the town will have built \( \boxed{144} \) homes over the next three years.

answer:  First, let's determine the speed of one kangaroo. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, the speed of one kangaroo is:

\[ \text{Speed of one kangaroo} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ kangaroos}} = 6 \text{ hours per hour} \]

Next, let's determine the speed of one turtle. Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is:

\[ \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{6 \text{ hours per hour}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to travel across the highway. Since each turtle takes 3 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles will take:

\[ \text{Time for four turtles} = 4 \text{ turtles} \times 3 \text{ hours per turtle} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 12 hours to travel across the highway.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Becca has 153

answer:  To determine how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Calculate how much money Roy has saved based on Anthony's savings.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 0.40 \times \text{Anthony's savings} \]
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = 30 + 0.40 \times 30 \]
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = 30 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

   - Number of new infections: \( 360 \times 6 = 2160 \)

Now, we sum the total number of people infected over the three days:
\[ 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 = 2590 \]

Therefore, after three days, there are 2590 people infected.

answer:  To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows.
2. Determine how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters.
3. Calculate how many additional cows are required to produce the remaining milk.

First, let's calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters per cow} = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we determine how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters:
\[ 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, we calculate how many additional cows are required to produce the remaining 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters per cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

answer:  To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. **First week:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
2. **Second week:** Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week:** Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's sum up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \]

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

answer:  To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   - Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   - Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   - Therefore, Rory made \( 20 + 20 = 40 \) dishes.

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   - Therefore, Jada made \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) dishes.

4. **Total Dishes:**
   - To find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made:
     - Kora's dishes: 20
     - Rory's dishes: 40
     - Jada's dishes: 80
   - Total: \( 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \)

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together is 140.

answer:  First, let's determine how many loaves Paige can bake in 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she can bake:

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so for 10 loaves:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paige raised $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons is:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the total cost from the initial amount of money:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has $19 left.

answer:  To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of lifting abilities step by step.

1. **Pompei's Ability:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's Ability:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's Ability:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's Ability:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain **40 feet** high.

answer:  To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has \(\frac{1}{6}\) left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \(\frac{2}{3}\) left:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \(\frac{1}{2}\) left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the remaining glue sticks:
\[
2 \text{ millimeters} + 8 \text{ millimeters} + 6 \text{ millimeters} = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

According to the problem:
1. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

answer:  First, calculate the annual interest rate. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Next, calculate the total interest over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Finally, add the total interest to the original investment to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, Brenda will have $975 in total after 3 years.

\[ \text{Jack's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Jack's socks} \]
\[ 60 = 2 \times \text{Jack's socks} \]
\[ \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:

\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack:

\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Erika already has in her purse as \( S \).

The original price of the laptop is $600, and after trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika has been paid $150 from her part-time job and her mom will give her $80. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have from these sources is:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have is:
\[ S + 230 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + 280 = 400 \]

Subtracting 280 from both sides:
\[ S = 400 - 280 \]
\[ S = 120 \]

So, Erika already has $120 in her purse.

\[ \text{Madeline's share per week} = 60\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ dollars} = 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Since Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the cost per week:
\[ \text{Keenan's share per week} = 40\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ dollars} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

answer:  First, find the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, calculate the average cost per pair of shoes by dividing the total annual expenditure by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes.

Next, find the number of white shirts without collars:
\[ \text{Number of white shirts without collars} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, find the number of floral shirts with buttons:
\[ \text{Number of floral shirts with buttons} = 20 \]

Then, find the number of floral shirts without buttons:
\[ \text{Number of floral shirts without buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Finally, calculate how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of floral shirts without buttons} - \text{Number of white shirts without collars} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

answer:  To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.
2. Subtract the amount of money Gabriel already has from the total cost.
3. Subtract the amount of money Gabriel's brother gave him from the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:
Cost of the car = $10000
Cost of the phone = $800
Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, we subtract the amount of money Gabriel already has from the total cost:
Money Gabriel has = $5000
Remaining amount = $10800 - $5000 = $5800

Finally, we subtract the amount of money Gabriel's brother gave him from the remaining amount:
Money Gabriel's brother gave him = $200
Amount still needed = $5800 - $200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

\boxed{5600}

answer:  To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find her hourly wage. Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly wage, we divide her total earnings by the total hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly wage} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Total hours}} = \frac{33 \text{ dollars}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now that we know her hourly wage, we can calculate her total earnings for 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Total hours} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 132 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

answer:  Let's denote your brother's age as \( B \).

1. You are three years younger than your brother, so your age is \( B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87:
\[ B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 5B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 5B = 96 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = 19 \]

So, your brother is 19 years old. Your age is \( B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16 \).

Therefore, you are 16 years old.

Next, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food before the discount:
\[ 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$18 \text{ per basket} = \$54 \]

Now, apply the discount to each basket of red food:
\[ \$18 \text{ per basket} - \$2 \text{ per basket} = \$16 \text{ per basket} \]

Calculate the total cost for the discounted red food:
\[ 3 \text{ baskets} \times \$16 \text{ per basket} = \$48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted red food to find the total cost:
\[ \$75 + \$48 = \$123 \]

answer:  To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell.
2. Determine the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell.
3. Find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

First, we know the total number of glasses sold is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses and Mitchell sold 9 glasses.

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 9 glasses. The difference is:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, let's calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply $800 by 0.10:

\[ 800 \times 0.10 = 80 \]

Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so she received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, let's find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1520 in tips altogether.

answer:  To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

1. **Total students in the class:** 20
2. **Students good at math only:** 5
3. **Students good at both math and English:** Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as \( x \).

The total number of students good at math is the sum of those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both math and English} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + x \]

Since we don't have the exact number of students good at both math and English (\( x \)), we can only express the total number of students good at math in terms of \( x \).

Therefore, the number of students good at math is \( 5 + x \).

\(\boxed{5+x}\)

answer:  To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs of glue sticks are required, given that each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

First, let's calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:

\[ \text{Total glue sticks} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Glue sticks per student} \]
\[ \text{Total glue sticks} = 27 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total glue sticks} = 54 \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required. Since each pack contains 8 glue sticks, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total glue sticks}}{\text{Glue sticks per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{54}{8} = 7 \]

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of each type of item:

1. Bacon: 5 packs cost $10, so each pack costs $10/5 = $2.
2. Chicken: Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs 2 * $2 = $4.
3. Strawberries: Each pack costs $4, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.
4. Apples: Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4/2 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:

- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: 6 * $4 = $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: 7 * $2 = $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so the amount left in her budget is:

$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.

answer:  To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins and then add the number of gold coins.

We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30 \]

Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 110 coins in total.

answer:  First, determine how many trays are needed by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:
\[ 900 \text{ eggs} \div 30 \text{ eggs/tray} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling the trays at $2.5 per tray:
\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

answer:  Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so she gave away 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 oranges.
She also gave her only boy 3 oranges, so she gave away a total of 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 oranges.
Therefore, Jennifer remained with 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 oranges.

answer:  Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.
The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so it weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.
The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so it weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

answer:  To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

answer:  To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned.
2. Determine the total time required to clean those rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

First, find the number of rooms to be cleaned:
\[ \text{Number of rooms to be cleaned} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, calculate the total time required to clean these rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

answer:  To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't find space to fit.
2. Determine the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs.
3. Calculate the number of pairs that can be arranged.

First, let's find the number of microphones that won't find space to fit:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find space to fit.

Next, we calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 microphones can be arranged in pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]

answer:  First, calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, he ate 10 pieces on the second day:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day:
\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Add up all the pieces eaten:
\[ 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pizza pieces so far.

\[ \boxed 48 \]

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the number of remaining plants:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of plants that are flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, 25% of the plants are flowering.

\[ \boxed{25} \]

answer:  First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles cost $21.00, the cost of one bottle is:

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21}{7} = 3 \]

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles cost $8.00, the cost of one bottle is:

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

\[ \text{Total cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 + 4 = 13 \]

So, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

answer:  Claire earns 1 badge every month, so in a year, she earns 1 badge * 12 months = 12 badges.

It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so Amber takes 1 month * 2 = 2 months to earn a badge.
In a year, Amber earns 1 badge/2 months * 12 months = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 1 badge * 3 = 3 badges per month.
In a year, Wendy earns 3 badges * 12 months = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.

answer:  First, let's determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns.

1. **Kamala's lawn:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Therefore, Kamala's lawn earnings: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

2. **Alba's lawn:**
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Therefore, Alba's lawn earnings: \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Total lawn earnings: \(18 + 30 = 48\) dollars.

Now, let's determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales:
- Total earnings for the month: $80
- Earnings from mowing lawns: $48

Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales:
\(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars.

answer:  To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Haircut**: Iris spent $400 to do her hair.
2. **Manicure**: She spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much as she did for the haircut.
   \[ \text{Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
3. **Pedicure**: She spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as she did for the manicure.
   \[ \text{Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Haircut} + \text{Manicure} + \text{Pedicure} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, Iris spent \( \boxed{575} \) at the spa.

answer:  To determine the number of yellow cars, we first need to calculate the number of green and blue cars and then use the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars.

1. **Number of green cars:**
   - The rink has 12 red cars.
   - They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10

2. **Number of blue cars:**
   - They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   - Number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30

3. **Total number of red, green, and blue cars:**
   - Total = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars
   - Total = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52

4. **Number of yellow cars:**
   - Total number of cars = 75
   - Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - Total red-green-blue cars
   - Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

answer:  To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles.

1. Calculate the additional distance Anis rowed:
   \[
   \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the total distance Anis rowed:
   \[
   \text{Total distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money Sarah will make from selling her original rope. The rope is 20 meters long and her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Profit from selling original rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2 \text{ per meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and Sarah wants to buy a rope that is 20 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5 \text{ per meter} = \$30 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \text{Profit from selling original rope} - \text{Cost of new rope} \]

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.

answer:  Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the length of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes.

Additionally, she performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the length of the encore:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

answer:  To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bolts:

Each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

6 \text{ (birds in the bushes)} + 4 \text{ (birds flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (birds feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds}
\]

Thus, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[

answer:  First, let's determine how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim uses to go fishing.

- Blue shoe boxes: Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- Red shoe boxes: Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, he uses \( \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \) red shoe boxes.

Next, let's calculate the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

- Blue shoe boxes: Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes. After using 3, he has \( 7 - 3 = 4 \) blue shoe boxes left.
- Red shoe boxes: Initially, Tim has 9 red shoe boxes. After using 3, he has \( 9 - 3 = 6 \) red shoe boxes left.

So, the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
- 4 blue shoe boxes
- 6 red shoe boxes

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is \( 4 + 6 = 10 \) shoe boxes.

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, we need to determine how many cookies are in each of the five jars. We do this by dividing the remaining number of cookies by the number of jars:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

Therefore, each jar contains 10 cookies.

answer:  Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens} \]

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars} \]

To achieve a profit of $2000, Isaias's total cost for 180 chickens must be:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens for $7000, the cost per chicken is:
\[ \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken} \]

Therefore, Isaias bought each chicken for approximately $38.89.

answer:  First, we need to determine the speed of a thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Speed of whatchamacallit} = 11 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} \]
\[ 121 = 11 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} \]

To find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

answer:  First, we need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this gives us the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 \text{ acres} + 500 \text{ acres} = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the two farms together have a total of 700 acres.

   Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.

2. **Carl's weight:**
   Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.
   \[
   \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} = 71 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Christian's weight:**
   Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \text{ kg} + 8 \text{ kg} = 79 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Harry's weight:**
   Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} = 74 \text{ kg}
   \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is \( 74 \) kg.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:

\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:

\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost of the carrots is:

\[ \text{Cost of carrots} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:

\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\text{Cost of carrots}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Thus, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

\( \boxed{1} \)

answer:  Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now.

In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + y \). According to the problem, this age will be thrice her present age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

\[ \boxed{16} \]

answer:  To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas made each day.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesday. Therefore, they make \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \) chimichangas.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on these three days:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

answer:  First, let's determine the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards of material.

Next, let's determine the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards of material.

Finally, let's add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Material needed for small masks: 10 yards
- Material needed for large masks: 6 yards
- Total material needed: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Jo needs 16 yards of material.

answer:  To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students participating in each activity.

1. Students playing tennis: 6
2. Students playing volleyball: Twice the number of tennis players, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
3. Students playing soccer: 16 boys + 22 girls = 38

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, there are 56 students in total.

answer:  To determine how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Denise read:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

Therefore, the total number of pages Denise read is:
\[ 10 + 18 = 28 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Daniel read:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel did not read any pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Daniel read is:
\[ 13 + 0 = 13 \]

Now, to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

answer:  To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Total petals from orchids = 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Total petals from daisies = 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we find the difference in the total number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- Difference in petals = Total petals from daisies - Total petals from orchids
- Difference in petals = 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

answer:  To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of years she has been collecting shells and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

1. Calculate the number of years Martha has been collecting shells:
   - Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.
   - By her 10th birthday, she will be 10 years old.
   - Therefore, she has been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years.

2. Calculate the number of months in 5 years:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, in 5 years, there are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

3. Calculate the total number of shells Martha will have collected:
   - Martha collects one shell each month.
   - Therefore, in 60 months, she will have collected 60 shells.

Thus, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

answer:  To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of movies Deepa has seen.
2. Calculate the total number of tickets she has bought.
3. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's find the total number of movies Deepa has seen:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- She has seen each movie 3 times.
- Total movies seen = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 movies.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tickets she has bought:
- Each movie is seen with 3 tickets.
- Total tickets = 27 movies * 3 tickets per movie = 81 tickets.

Now, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket:
- Total amount spent = $216
- Total tickets = 81
- Average price per ticket = $216 / 81 = $3

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $3.

answer:  First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 per hour, and they raised his pay by $2 per hour.

\[ \text{New hourly wage} = \$10 + \$2 = \$12 \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.

\[ \text{Hours per week} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we multiply Mark's new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$12 \text{ per hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = \$480 \]

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

1. Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour.
2. Determine the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday.
3. Calculate Colby's earnings based on his pay rate.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes per hour:
Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday:
\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Finally, we calculate Colby's earnings based on his pay rate:
\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

2. Subtract the number of marbles given to Jamie from the total number of marbles.
3. Subtract the number of marbles given to Donald from the remaining marbles.

First, let's calculate the number of marbles Dean gives to Jamie:

Next, we subtract the number of marbles given to Jamie from the total number of marbles:
\[ \text{Remaining marbles after Jamie} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of marbles given to Donald from the remaining marbles:
\[ \text{Marbles given to Donald} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Remaining marbles after Donald} = 24 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

answer:  Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost 5 * $10 = $50.
He has also seen 8 movies on other days, which cost 8 * $7 = $56.
He has bought 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost 2 * $8 = $16.
He has bought 4 boxes of candy, which cost 4 * $2 = $8.
So far, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.
Colby's parents gave him $150 to spend at the movies, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.
Colby wants to buy popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.
So, he has $20 - $10 = $10 left for movie tickets.
Since movie tickets on Friday or Saturday cost $10 each, Colby can buy $10 / $10 = 1 more movie.
In total, he can see 5 + 1 = 6 movies.

answer:  To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum up the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ hours (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph initially had 6 notebooks.

After Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she now has:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha now has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8 \text{ per lollipop} = \$240 \]

Then, calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5 \text{ per lollipop} = \$150 \]

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \$90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

answer:  First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku puzzle, which takes 45 minutes.

\[ \text{Time for extreme Sudoku} = 4 \times 45 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours, since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 3 hours.

\[ \text{Number of half-hour intervals} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours per interval}} = 6 \text{ intervals} \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

\[ \text{6 bottles} \]

answer:  To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys Sophie has before buying the bouncy balls.
2. Subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie has before buying the bouncy balls:

- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

Adding these together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

So, Sophie has 48 toys before buying the bouncy balls.

Next, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bowls needed for the dinner:
- Calvin is an adult, so he needs 1 bowl.
- His wife is an adult, so she needs 1 bowl.
- They have two children, so they need 2 bowls.

Total bowls needed for dinner = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 bowls.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soup available:
- The pot has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.

Since we need 4 adult's bowls for dinner, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 8 child's bowls.

Now, let's determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:
- There are 8 child's bowls of soup available.
- Each child will have 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

To find how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls per child:
- Each child can have a bowl of soup = 8 bowls / 2 bowls per child = 4 times.

answer:  To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney and then find the average of those distances.

First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.
- Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Next, let's calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.
- Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's find the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Finally, let's calculate the average total distance spat:
- Average distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average distance = 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet.

answer:  First, let's determine how many cups of cinnamon tea Lana uses. Since she has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows, each row contains:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Lana uses 15 cups of cinnamon tea, so the number of cups left for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Since each row contains equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, and there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row. Since there are 3 rows and each row contains equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, each row contains 2 cups of mint tea.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the cake and the balloons:

- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost for 12 balloons is \( \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 3 \) dollars.

The total cost for the cake and balloons is \( 11 + 3 = 14 \) dollars.

Next, let's add the cost of the ice cream:

- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the cost for the ice cream is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) dollars.

The total amount spent is \( 14 + 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend $28, and they were given the same amount, each of them must have spent \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) dollars.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

answer:  To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total 24 hours in a day.

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.
2. **Working**: Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps. Since he sleeps for 10 hours, he works for:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Walking the dog**: Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we add up the hours spent on these activities:
\[
10 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we subtract this total from the total 24 hours in a day:
\[
24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

answer:  First, let's determine the calories in one mini cinnamon roll and one mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.

Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   - Number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   - Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   - Number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has 1/3 the number of fish he has.
   - Number of gerbils = 1/3 * 21 = 7

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

answer:  Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 \]
\[ A + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

answer:  Let's denote the age of Jean as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age is \( J + 10 \).
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

So, Jean is 20 years old.

Now, we can find Peter's age:
\[ \text{Peter's age} = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

answer:  To determine the total charge for Patty's plumbing service, we need to calculate the visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty charges $40 to visit the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: Patty charges $35 per hour for labor, and the job took 2.25 hours.

First, let's calculate the labor charge:
\[ \text{Labor Charge} = 35 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2.25 \text{ hours} = 78.75 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Cost of Parts**: Patty charges $60 for parts.

Now, let's add up all the charges:
\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Cost of Parts} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 78.75 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 178.75 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate the total number of trips he needs to make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours to make one trip, we divide the total time by the time for one trip:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we know the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total. To find out how many berries he can pick up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]

\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine the remaining number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, calculate the number of yellow balloons:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

answer:  The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.
Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * $6 = $259200.
The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * $6 = $194400.
Therefore, Fern will make $259200 - $194400 = $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000.

answer:  To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result of step 2 to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is \( 7 \times 70 = 490 \).
3. Subtract 40 from 490: \( 490 - 40 = 450 \).

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

answer:  To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removes over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Next, we sum up the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 \]

Now, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5) to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

So, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60.

\[ \boxed{60} \]

Finally, add the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother:

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650 letters.

answer:  Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by the team is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

answer:  To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed per day by both Abby and Josh.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices consumed per day:

\[ 24 \div 6 = 4 \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

   8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Next, let's add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom:

1. Maria's mom gave each of the 5 people 3 more balloons:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Finally, let's find the total number of water balloons the girls had:

\[
9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons}
\]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\).

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ \text{Original cost} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ \text{Discount} = 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \]

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ \text{Total amount received} = 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount James spent:

\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Discounted price} - \text{Amount received} = 90 - 200 = -110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James was out $110.

Therefore, the amount of money James was out is:

\[ \text{Amount out} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  First, we need to determine how much water is initially in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate:

\[ \text{Initial water in the tank} = \frac{10000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used over the 6 days. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ \text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be \( 2000 \) gallons of water remaining in the tank.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, he has:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. He has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \text{ utensils} \]

- A 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, calculate the cost of a 12-hour stay:
- A 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Now, calculate the cost for the additional hours after 12 hours:
- Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, which is 5 hours after 5 pm.
- Each additional hour costs 70 pesos.
- Total cost for additional hours = 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

Now, add the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours:
- Total cost for 12-hour stay = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Finally, subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
- Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

answer:  To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
- Distance traveled by the bus = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
- Distance traveled by the car = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles
- Distance traveled by the car: 240 miles
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is 60 miles.

answer:  To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to adjust for the 20% overstating that Courtney reported.

First, calculate 20% of the reported number:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Next, subtract this amount from the reported number to find the actual number:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so we need to find out how many tables are required:
\[ 60 \text{ boxes} \div 2 \text{ boxes/table} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

answer:  To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children per row by the number of rows per school and then by the number of schools.

1. Number of children per row: 8
2. Number of rows per school: 7
3. Number of schools: 5

First, calculate the number of children per school:
\[ \text{Number of children per school} = \text{Number of children per row} \times \text{Number of rows per school} \]
\[ \text{Number of children per school} = 8 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of children per school} = 56 \]

Next, calculate the total number of children across all schools:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of children per school} \times \text{Number of schools} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 56 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 280 \]

Therefore, the total number of children that can be in the drill is 280.

answer:  To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch.
3. Each paper is printed on both sides, so each sheet of paper contains 2 pages.

First, calculate the total number of sheets of paper in the book:
\[ \text{Total sheets} = \frac{\text{Thickness of the book}}{\text{Pages per inch}} = \frac{1.5 \text{ inches}}{100 \text{ pages/inch}} = 0.015 \text{ sheets} \]

Next, since each sheet contains 2 pages, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Total sheets} \times \text{Pages per sheet} = 0.015 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 0.03 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book contains 0.03 pages.

answer:  To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to get the total cost.

1. The cost of the supplies is $400.
2. The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies. To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
   \[
   0.50 \times 400 = 200
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the tickets is:
   \[
   400 + 200 = 600
   \]
3. The total cost of the travel is the sum of the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets:
   \[
   400 + 600 = 1000
   \]

So, the total cost of Jen's travel is \boxed{1000} dollars.

answer:  To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Number of yams: 6
   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = \$9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = \$20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = \$5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ \$9 \text{ (yams)} + \$20 \text{ (sweet potatoes)} + \$5 \text{ (carrots)} = \$34 \]

Jen will earn $34 from selling all her root crops.

answer:  First, determine the amount of hay each sheep needs:
- Each goat needs 5 pounds.
- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
- Twice the amount each goat needs is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) pounds.
- Therefore, each sheep needs \( 10 - 3 = 7 \) pounds.

Next, calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats:
- There are 15 goats.
- Each goat needs 5 pounds.
- Total hay for goats = \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \) pounds.

Then, calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep:
- There are 12 sheep.
- Each sheep needs 7 pounds.
- Total hay for sheep = \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \) pounds.

Finally, add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total hay needed:
- Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

answer:  The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of the beds are occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied beds is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Initially, the number of unoccupied beds is:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

So, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks will be:

\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had:

1. She made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies.
3. Her friends brought her 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

So, Greta had a total of 66 brownies.

Next, let's determine how many brownies were eaten during the party:

1. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the number of brownies left over:

1. Total brownies: 66
2. Brownies eaten: 18

Subtracting the number of eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

answer:  First, calculate the commission for each type of newspaper:

- For the New York Times:
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Price per copy: $5
  - Number of copies sold: 6
  - Commission per copy: $5 * 0.10 = $0.50
  - Total commission from New York Times: 6 copies * $0.50/copy = $3

- For the Wall Street Journal:
  - Commission rate: 8%
  - Price per copy: $15
  - Number of copies sold: 10
  - Commission per copy: $15 * 0.08 = $1.20
  - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * $1.20/copy = $12

Now, add the commissions from both types of newspapers to find the total commission:

- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total of $15 in commission.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles, and the teacher has 9 coupons.

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students. Each student receives 2 bottles, and there are 29 students in the class.

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemed to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, after redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

answer:  To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team and then add it to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Given:
- Carlton's team has 13 players.
- Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team.

First, calculate the number of players on Zeke's team:
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Next, add the number of players on both teams:
\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

The answer is 33.

answer:  Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Now, we can find the number of balls carried by Jason and Jordan:
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each:
\[ \text{Total balls} = \text{Jeffrey's balls} + \text{Jason's balls} + \text{Jordan's balls} = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \( 7 \).

answer:  To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he stapled and then multiply that by his rate of stapling.

First, let's determine the total time Vince stapled:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 5 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours is 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 300 minutes:
- 300 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 20 intervals.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 20 intervals, he can staple:
- 20 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 600 reports.

Thus, Vince stapled 600 reports altogether.

answer:  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim the first part of the lake.
After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
The remaining distance to swim is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.
He swims this remaining distance at half the speed of 2 miles per hour, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
It takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.
The total time James takes to get across the lake is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

answer:  To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the books.
2. Subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from the total cost.
3. Divide the remaining amount by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the books:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we subtract the amount Tyler has already saved from the total cost:
- Amount saved: $14

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount saved
Remaining amount = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we divide the remaining amount by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:
- Hourly wage: $5

Hours needed = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work **5 hours** to afford his books.

answer:  Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem:
- Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught \boxed{147} Pokemon.

answer:  To find the total cost of both cars, we need to determine the price of the red car first. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100.

1. Calculate 40% of the price of the blue car:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40
   \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60
   \]

3. Add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car to find the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price of the blue car} + \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \$160.

answer:  First, let's determine Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old. So, Marcus's age is:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

Substituting Marcus's age into the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

answer:  To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that are not work emails.
2. Determine how many of the remaining emails are to her family.
3. Calculate the number of emails sent to her boyfriend.

1. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]

2. Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, the number of emails to her family is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

3. One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. The remaining emails are:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
   Therefore, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]

Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend.

answer:  First, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we calculate:

\[ \text{Nani's brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Next, we need to determine the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find this, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:

\[ \text{25% of Nani's age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Nani's sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Now, we add the ages of all three family members to find the total age:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Nani's brother's age} + \text{Nani's sister's age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.

answer:  To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = \text{perimeter} \times \text{slats per foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ slats/foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug on the first three days:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes on the first three days = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes on the first day, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day would be:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. We know the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40, and the total number of holes dug on the first three days is 31. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 31 = 9 \]

So, the pirates dug 9 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The answer is:
\[ 9 \]

answer:  Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. 

On that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking from the total time she was awake:

Total time awake = 5:55 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. = 5 hours and 55 minutes = 5 * 60 + 55 = 335 minutes

Time spent sleepwalking = 23 minutes

Time slept on the bed = Total time awake - Time spent sleepwalking
Time slept on the bed = 335 minutes - 23 minutes = 312 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 312 minutes today.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:

- Number of petunias: 3
- Cost per petunia: $3.00
- Total cost for petunias: \( 3 \times 3.00 = $9.00 \)

- Number of sweet potato vines: 2
- Cost per sweet potato vine: $2.50
- Total cost for sweet potato vines: \( 2 \times 2.50 = $5.00 \)

- Total cost for one basket: \( 9.00 + 5.00 = $14.00 \)

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 baskets:

- Total cost for one basket: $14.00
- Total cost for 5 baskets: \( 5 \times 14.00 = $70.00 \)

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

answer:  To determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries each person has.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. Let's denote the number of cherries Jerry has as \( J \).

The total number of cherries is the sum of the cherries Robert, Richard, and Jerry have:
\[ 30 + 20 + J = 60 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ 50 + J = 60 \]
\[ J = 60 - 50 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of episodes.
2. Determine the length of each episode.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching the show.

First, let's find the number of episodes:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

So, the number of episodes is:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Minutes per episode}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know each episode is 20 minutes long.

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching the show:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

\[ \boxed{200} \]

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

1. **Synthetic gut racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes

2. **Polyester string racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes

3. **Hybrid set racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we sum up the times for all types of racquets:

- Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

answer:  First, calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner:
- On low mode for 3 hours: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees
- On high mode for 4 hours: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees
- Total cooling effect of the air conditioner: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Next, calculate the warming effect of the room without the air conditioner:
- The room would warm up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
- The room was turned off for 2 hours, so it warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, calculate the net temperature change:
- Net cooling effect: 18 degrees
- Net warming effect: 4 degrees
- Net temperature change: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

#### 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

answer:  To determine the total number of corn chips, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of corn chips each person received.
2. Calculate the total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey.
3. Determine the number of corn chips Collins received.
4. Add the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins to find the total.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. The total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey is \( 70 + 70 = 140 \).
3. Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Since Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.
4. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins: \( 140 + 85 = 225 \).

Therefore, the total number of corn chips altogether is \(\boxed{225}\).

answer:  First, let's determine Emil's age when he turns 24. Since he is currently 19 years old, he will be:

\[ 19 + 5 = 24 \]

When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. Let's denote his dad's age at that time as \( D \) and his brother's age at that time as \( B \). According to the problem:

\[ 24 = \frac{D}{2} \]
\[ 24 = 2B \]

From these equations, we can solve for \( D \) and \( B \):

\[ D = 24 \times 2 = 48 \]
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. Since Emil is currently 19 years old, his dad and his brother must be:

\[ 48 + 12 - 19 = 41 \]

The answer is:
\[ 41 \]

answer:  To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First segment of the journey:**
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second segment of the journey:**
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third segment of the journey:**
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we sum the distances from all three segments:

300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

Therefore, the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.

answer:  Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges initially. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges given away is:
\[ 4 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 80 \text{ oranges} \]

After giving away 80 oranges, the number of oranges left is:
\[ 240 \text{ oranges} - 80 \text{ oranges} = 160 \text{ oranges} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 160 \text{ oranges} = 40 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 160 \text{ oranges} - 40 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

So, Mrs. Harrington sold \boxed{120} oranges.

answer:  To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots.
3. Divide the total size by 2 to find the average.

First, we know that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. Since Sophie wears size 5 boots, the size of Charlie's boots is:
\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots:
\[ \text{Total size} = \text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total size by 2 to find the average:
\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie is \( \boxed{15} \).

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door.

answer:  John decides to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which is a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are bought at the full price of $600 each.
The remaining 2 phones are bought at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each.

So, the total cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.
The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Therefore, the total cost for all the phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations is:

They bought a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:

answer:  To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter.
2. Divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars per box.

First, let's find the total number of boxes sold:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Next, we know they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{\text{Total number of chocolate bars}}{\text{Total number of boxes}} \]
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in each box.

answer:  To determine the total number of states in both the USA and India, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of states in the USA.
2. Calculate the number of states in India based on the given relationship.
3. Add the number of states in both countries to get the total.

Step 1: Identify the number of states in the USA.
The USA has 50 states.

Step 2: Calculate the number of states in India.
India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, we first find half the number of states in the USA:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
Then, we add 4 to this value:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]
So, India has 29 states.

Step 3: Add the number of states in both countries.
We add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\).

answer:  To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to add up the beads she received from each person.

1. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.

First, let's calculate the number of beads her sister gave her:
- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother.
- Therefore, her sister gave her \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) beads.

Next, let's calculate the number of beads her friend gave her:
- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.
- Therefore, her friend gave her \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads she received:
- Mother: 20 beads
- Sister: 30 beads
- Friend: 40 beads

Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads

answer:  To determine Bill's age when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.
2. Determine Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
3. Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time.

First, we know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

Next, we are told that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Since Bill saw the Comet a second time 75 years after the first time (as Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years), his age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over the 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, divide the total amount of sunscreen required by the amount per bottle:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \div 8 \text{ ounces/bottle} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the pool is) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

\[ V = 14 \, \text{ft} \times 25 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]

\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert this volume to gallons by multiplying by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times \$0.10/\text{gallon} = \$826 \]

The answer is $826.

answer:  First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches:

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Next, let's account for the space between the plants:

1.5 feet = 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches

Subtract the space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed:

1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches

Now, let's determine how many flowers are needed to fill the flower bed:

1314 inches / 12 inches per flower = 112 flowers

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

112 flowers - 17 flowers = 95 flowers

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for 95 flowers is:

95 flowers * $6 per flower = $570

Therefore, Pat will spend $570 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

answer:  To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father.
2. Subtract the amount received from his mother and father from the total cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

- Adam's mother gave him $6.
- Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives us the total amount received from his mother and father:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount received from his mother and father from the total cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The answer is \( \boxed{12} \).

2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany:

4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = \text{Shaelyn's laps} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, let's find how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Bethany's laps} - \text{Quinn's laps} = 10 - 5 = 5

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
  \[
  4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
  \]
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
  \[
  \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[
3 \text{ pounds} + 12 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the weight of one serving:
\[
\frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings}
\]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount for buying plums is:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy is:

$0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the remaining money.

answer:  To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.
2. Calculate the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

First, we know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Edgar's brother eats half as many as Edgar. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 \]

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's daily pretzels} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily number of pretzels by 7:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 \]

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's weekly pretzels} = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

answer:  First, we need to determine how much money Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. She saves 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck:

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of slices each family member gets. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is:

\[ 2 \text{ adults} + 4 \text{ kids} = 6 \text{ slices} \]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. If each kid gets 1 slice, then each adult gets 2 slices.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. The total number of slices is 6, and each adult gets 2 slices. Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of slices each adult gets}}{\text{Total number of slices}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{6} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

So, each adult gets \(\boxed{33.33\%}\) of the watermelon.

answer:  To determine how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to read 18 pages of his book. We know that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

First, let's find out how many pages James can read in 1 minute. Since he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, his reading rate is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to read 18 pages. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by his reading rate:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

answer:  To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sauteing the shrimp.

1. **Peeling the shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

2. **Sauteing the shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, she will need to do \( \frac{90}{30} = 3 \) sets of 30 shrimp.
   - Each set takes 10 minutes, so for 3 sets, it will take \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time for peeling and the time for sauteing to find the total time:
- Total time = 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes.

#### 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

answer:  To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the number of checks he writes for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric Bill**: 1 check per month
2. **Gas Bill**: 1 check per month
3. **Church**: 2 checks per month
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: 1 check every 3 months

First, let's calculate the number of checks for each category in a year:

- **Electric Bill**: 1 check per month * 12 months = 12 checks
- **Gas Bill**: 1 check per month * 12 months = 12 checks
- **Church**: 2 checks per month * 12 months = 24 checks
- **Pest and Lawn Service**: 1 check every 3 months * (12 months / 3) = 4 checks

Now, let's sum up all the checks:

\[ 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 \]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year.

answer:  To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session.
2. Calculate the total cost per session.
3. Calculate the total cost per week.
4. Calculate the total cost per month.

1. The cost per session is the sum of the rental cost and the cost per student:
   - Rental cost per session: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Total cost per session: $25 + $1.50 = $26

2. The total cost per session is the cost per session multiplied by the number of students:
   - Total cost per session: $26 * 10 = $260

3. The total cost per week is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of days per week:
   - Total cost per week: $260 * 3 = $780

4. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month:
   - Total cost per month: $780 * 4 = $3120

answer:  Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as \( S \). According to the problem, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of large stuffed animals she sold is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the revenue from small stuffed animals is \( 4S \).

Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars. Therefore, the revenue from large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times \frac{S}{2} = 6S \).

The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is:
\[ 4S + 6S = 10S \]

We know that the total revenue is $120, so:
\[ 10S = 120 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{120}{10} \]
\[ S = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

Given that the first plane makes three-quarters of its flights to Greece, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout the day. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 44 = \frac{1}{2}F \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 \]
\[ F = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in one day. The number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Therefore, the first plane takes 22 flights to France in one day.

answer:  To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
\[ \text{Total sticks} = \text{Red sticks} + \text{Blue sticks} + \text{Yellow sticks} \]
\[ \text{Total sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 \]
\[ \text{Total sticks} = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34.

answer:  First, let's determine the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
- Akbar's age: 3 years
- Alessandro's age: 4 years
- Total age of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7 years

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age of the children divided by the number of children:
- Total age of the children: 20 years
- Number of children: 4
- Average age: 20 / 4 = 5 years

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
- Helene's age: 2 * 5 = 10 years

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the children:
- Total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene: 7 + 10 = 17 years
- Wilfred's age: 20 - 17 = 3 years

Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3 years old.

answer:  One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

If there are 40 dwarves, each with a steel pickaxe, they can mine a total of 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

In a month with 30 days, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore.

answer:  On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
In total, Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.
The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so there are 18000 - 7500 - 4500 = 6000 gallons remaining.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of money Walter has collected so far:

1. From his neighbors: $500
2. From the online fund: $1500
3. From his friend: $200

Adding these together:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on his rounds and appointments.

1. Time spent on rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - It takes 20 minutes to check each patient.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/patient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's find the total time spent on rounds and appointments:
- Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, which is equivalent to 9 * 60 = 540 minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the time left for updating his records:
- Time left for updating records = 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine how many pieces Anne kept for herself:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, subtract the number of pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces she gave to her friends:
\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:
\[ 780 \text{ pieces} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

answer:  To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for each step and then subtract that from the desired finish time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Since 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours and 0 minutes, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

answer:  Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as \( x \).

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can write:
\[ 4x = 64 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can write:
\[ 7x = 56 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

answer:  To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each event and how they combine.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher**: 50% or 0.50
2. **Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension**: 40% or 0.40
3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension**: 60% or 0.60
4. **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension if the class doesn't get an extension**: 20% or 0.20

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of having a substitute teacher**: 50% or 0.50
- **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension**: 60% or 0.60
- **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension**: 20% or 0.20

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension, which is 0.60 or 60%.

   The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkout:**
   24 guests opted for an early checkout.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkout:**
   15 guests opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-in:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]

5. **After dinner check-in:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner was served.
   \[
   61 + 30 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. The total population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year.

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines} = 30 \times 4 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Finally, we add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, after a year, there will be 1,490 porcupines in the park.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
Ted buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6.
\[ 3 \text{ pencils} \times \$6 \text{ per pencil} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$48 + \$18 = \$66 \]

answer:  To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Matteo's time: 4 hours

Distance traveled by Matteo = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Shandy's time: 10 hours

Distance traveled by Shandy = Speed × Time
Distance traveled by Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo
Difference in distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

answer:  To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the daily sandwich consumption for each member and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily sandwich consumption for each family member:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Next, we sum the daily sandwich consumption for all family members:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, we multiply the daily sandwich consumption by the number of days in a week:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

answer:  First, calculate the number of students over 16 years old:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students

Next, calculate the number of male students over 16 years old:
1500 * (1/4) = 375 male students

Then, calculate the number of female students over 16 years old:
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students

Now, calculate the number of students under 16 years old:
3000 - 1500 = 1500 students

Next, calculate the number of male students under 16 years old:
1500 * (1/2) = 750 male students

Then, calculate the number of female students under 16 years old:
1500 - 750 = 750 female students

Finally, add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old:
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students

The answer is 1875.

answer:  Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost in the first 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 0.09C = 0.45C \]

During the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost in the next 3 hours is:
\[ 3 \times 0.07C = 0.21C \]

The total charge lost over the 8 hours is:
\[ 0.45C + 0.21C = 0.66C \]

The remaining charge is given as 28% of the initial charge:
\[ 0.34C = 0.28C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.34} \]
\[ C = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was 80% fully charged.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of money Jim received in loans over the 4-year period: $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

Next, determine how much money Jim lost by not working during those 4 years: $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

Now, calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Jim's college degree tripled his income, so his new annual income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000, divide the total amount by his new annual income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the equivalent of the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

answer:  To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich and then apply it to 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.50>>1.50 per sandwich.

2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 sandwiches = $<<6/4=1.50>>1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:

- Price per sandwich = $1.50
- Number of sandwiches = 8
- Total cost = $1.50 * 8 = $<<1.50*8=12>>12

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

answer:  First, calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:
- Weekly earnings from wages: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week
- Weekly earnings from tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
- Total weekly earnings: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Next, determine how much Janet needs to save for the downpayment:
- Downpayment: 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Now, calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000:
- Number of weeks: $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the downpayment.

answer:  To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase each year to the initial price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   - Initial price: $120
   - Increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price: $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Initial price: $126
   - Increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Initial price: $132.30
   - Increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price: $132.30 + $6.615 = $139

answer:  To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost or won, we need to calculate the total amount lost or won and then divide by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost or won:

- Lost: $5
- Won: $11
- Lost: $16.5

Total loss = $5 + $11 - $16.5 = $10.5

Since there are 3 races, we divide the total loss by the number of races to find the average:

Average loss = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5

So, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.50 per race on that day.

answer:  To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available in the Fine Arts Center.
2. Subtract the number of seats for faculty from the total number of seats to find the number of seats for graduates.
3. Divide the number of seats for graduates by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

First, let's find the total number of seats available in the Fine Arts Center:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 6000 \]

Next, we subtract the number of seats for faculty from the total number of seats:
\[ \text{Seats for graduates} = 6000 - 300 = 5700 \]

Now, we divide the number of seats for graduates by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Number of graduates} = 950 \]
\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{5700}{950} = 6 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

answer:  Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Since 3 of the albums were selfies only, we calculate the total number of selfies:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

Since 2 of the albums were portraits, we calculate the total number of portraits:

\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and the number of portraits:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ portraits and selfies} \]

Therefore, Olivia had a total of 45 portraits and selfies.

answer:  To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
2. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:

- The team worked for 3 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the team worked for \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Each day, they worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day, which is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.

So, the total number of hours worked by the team is:
\[ 21 \times 9 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in \(47.25\) hours of work.

answer:  First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

From cookies:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 \text{ per cookie} = \$80 \]

From cupcakes:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 \text{ per cupcake} = \$240 \]

Total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Suzanne gave to her two sisters.

Each sister received $10, so:
\[ 2 \text{ sisters} \times \$10 \text{ per sister} = \$20 \]

Now, let's subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings.

\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Therefore, Suzanne has \$300 left from her earnings.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of soda bottles needed.
2. Determine the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.
3. Multiply the number of bottles by the time to move between them.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles needed:
- The driveway is 24 feet wide.
- Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.
- Therefore, the number of bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) bottles.

Next, we know that it takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.

Now, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to move between them:
- Number of bottles = 8
- Time to move between bottles = 5 seconds

Total time = \( 8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \) seconds.

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

- Average questions: (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
- Difficult questions: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18

Next, let's calculate how many questions Aries is sure to answer correctly in each category:

- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9

Now, let's add up the number of correct answers:

- Total correct answers: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points.

answer:  To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already driven and then subtract that from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days.

First, calculate the total distance driven:
\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

Next, subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

answer:  First, determine the dimensions of each piece of fabric:
- The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.
- Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece of fabric = Length * Width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area needed = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

answer:  To determine how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining amount Tom has to pay after selling his old bedroom.
2. Determine the monthly payment based on the remaining amount.

First, let's find the remaining amount Tom has to pay after selling his old bedroom:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total cost of bedroom set} - \text{Amount paid by selling old bedroom} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 3000 - 1000 \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To find the monthly payment, we calculate:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 10\% \times \text{Remaining amount} \]
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 0.10 \times 2000 \]
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay **$200** per month for the bedroom set.

answer:  To determine the cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the kitchen floor.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed to cover the floor.
3. Calculate the total cost of the tiles.

1. The total area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet.

2. Since each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, the number of tiles needed is equal to the area of the kitchen floor. Therefore, you need 200 tiles.

3. Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Tiles} \times \text{Cost per Tile}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 200 \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 2400
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with new square floor tiles is $2400.

First, let's find the population of one country:
- Each country has 5 cities.
- Each city has 1000 people.

So, the population of one country is:
\[ 5 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people/city} = 5000 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's find the total population for all 26 countries:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5000 \text{ people.country} = 130000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000 people.

1. Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat.
2. Convert the number of medium-sized beans into small beans.

First, we know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[ 3 \times 150 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

answer:  Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of tennis balls retrieved is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 15 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, Rory retrieved 7.5 tennis balls in the second set.

In the first set, he retrieved:
\[ x + 4 = 7.5 + 4 = 11.5 \] tennis balls.

answer:  To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add the number of stickers he collected over the years to the initial number of stickers he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year.

First, let's calculate the number of stickers he collected this year:
- Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
- This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, let's add up all the stickers he has:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Total stickers = 100 + 50 + 100

Total stickers = 100 + 50 + 100 = 250

Therefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

answer:  First, find the total number of apples Uncle Franky has by multiplying the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, determine how many packs of apples he can make by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

answer:  To determine Melissa's jury pay per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Subtract her daily parking expenses from her daily pay.
3. Divide the net daily pay by the total number of hours to find the hourly pay.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's subtract her daily parking expenses from her daily pay:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} - 3 \text{ dollars/day} = 12 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we divide the net daily pay by the total number of hours to find the hourly pay:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars/day}}{18 \text{ hours}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa's jury pay per hour after expenses is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ dollars per hour} \]

answer:  To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups to gallons.

First, let's find the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days. Since she drinks 8 cups every day, we multiply the number of cups per day by the number of days:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon, so we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

answer:  To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, we sum up the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

answer:  To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual expenses:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the 30-minute visit: $300/hour * 30 minutes = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, add all these costs together:

$200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

So, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is $482.

answer:  To determine how much James pays a year for his insurance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 per month.
- The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

Now, add this to the normal cost to get the increased monthly cost:
\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

answer:  To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for both the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- Number of people wanting the chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $<<10*6.50=65>>65

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting the pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad: $6
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6/person = $<<6*6=36>>36

Now, we add the total costs for the chicken salad and the pasta salad:
- Total cost for chicken salad: $65
- Total cost for pasta salad: $36
- Total cost = $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101

Therefore, Molly will pay $101 for the catering.

answer:  To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all three cats.

Each cat is fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, the amount of cat food consumed per day by one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/feed} \times 2 \text{ feeds/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all three cats is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

answer:  To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the three years from 2007 to 2010.

1. **Price in 2008:**
   - Initial price: $20000
   - Depreciation rate: 21%
   - Depreciation amount: $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
   - Price in 2008: $20000 - $4200 = $15800

2. **Price in 2009:**
   - Initial price: $15800
   - Depreciation rate: 21%
   - Depreciation amount: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318
   - Price in 2009: $15800 - $3318 = $12482

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $12482.

answer:  First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to account for the grocery store's promotion, which is buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only needs to pay for 1 pound. Therefore, to get 6 pounds of butter, he only needs to pay for:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the butter. The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound, so the cost for 3 pounds is:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Dennis $12.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter.

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, calculate the number of German books:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times 0.10 = 5 \]

Now, subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books:
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

answer:  To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response each day.
2. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
3. Multiply the number of emails that require a response each day by the number of days in a week.

First, calculate the number of emails that don't require a response each day:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails per day} \]

Next, calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails per day} \]

Finally, multiply the number of emails that require a response each day by the number of days in a week:
\[ 64 \text{ emails per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails per week} \]

So, James responds to \( 320 \) emails in a 5-day work week.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   \[
   120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 20 people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 50 people descend from the train.
   - Twice the number of people who descended (which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)) board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - 80 people descend from the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}
\]

answer:  First, determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, he wants to send out:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the cost for 700 small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 0.05 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the cost for 1400 big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 0.15 = 2100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons to find the total postage cost:
\[ 350 + 2100 = 2450 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]

answer:  To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to add up the costs of each item she bought.

1. **Tank Top**: The tank top cost $10.
2. **Running Shorts**: The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. Therefore, the cost is $10 + $5 = $15.
3. **Tennis Shoes**: The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. Therefore, the sale price is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. **Athletic Socks**: The athletic socks cost $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off. Therefore, the discounted price of the socks is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we add up all the costs:

- Tank Top: $10
- Running Shorts: $15
- Tennis Shoes: $24
- Athletic Socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent a total of $55 = $<<55=55>>55.

answer:  To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many toothpicks she still needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks she will need to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie an additional 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

answer:  To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he uses per week and then extend that to a year.

1. **Sets used per week:**
   - Twin beds: 4 sets
   - King beds: 1 set
   - Total sets per week = 4 + 1 = 5 sets

2. **Sets used in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total sets per year = 5 sets/week * 52 weeks = 260 sets

3. **Laundry machine capacity:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.
   - Total sets per load = 2 twin sets + 1 king set = 3 sets

4. **Number of loads needed:**
   - Total sets per year = 260 sets
   - Sets per load = 3 sets
   - Number of loads = 260 sets / 3 sets/load = 80 loads

Therefore, Greg does 80 loads of laundry per year.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people Kayla invited:
- Classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13

Total invited people = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we subtract the number of people who said they could not come:
- People who could not come: 4

Total people attending = 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost of renting the theater:
- Base fee for 20 guests: $125
- Additional fee per guest: $6

Number of additional guests = Total people attending - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21

Additional cost = Number of additional guests * Additional fee per guest = 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee and the additional cost:
Total cost = Base fee + Additional cost = $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party will be $251.

- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
- On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday, so they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

Therefore, the total number of movies they watch in one weekend is:
\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Next, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since there are 2 weekends in a week, in 4 weeks there are:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ weekends} \]

So, the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks is:
\[ 6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 8 \text{ weekends} = 48 \text{ movies} \]

The answer is 48.

answer:  To determine the total time James spent walking, we need to calculate the time he spent walking to the store and the time he spent walking back home.

1. **Walk to the store:**
   - Distance to the store: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

2. **Walk back home:**
   - Distance back home: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to the store + Time back home
   - Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James a total of 2 hours to reach the store.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of slices in the 4 pizzas. Each pizza has 8 slices, so:

\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 \text{ slices} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 \text{ slices (Becky)} + 7 \text{ slices (Jake)} + 14 \text{ slices (Silvia)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 31 \text{ slices} \]

answer:  Let's denote the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of the time it took for Betsy's part and Donovan's part, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the 15 roses. Since each rose costs $2, the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jenny paid. She paid with five 5 dollar bills:

\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5 \text{ per bill} = \$25 \]

Now, let's find out how much change Jenny receives. Subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount she paid:

\[ \$25 - \$20 = \$5 \]

Jenny receives $5 in change. Since the florist only gives quarters as change, we need to determine how many quarters are equivalent to $5. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so we divide $5 by $0.25:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25 \text{ per quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters.

answer:  To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add the number of classes that visited each day.

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, so \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is \( \boxed{247 \).

answer:  To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests.
2. Add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests.
3. Divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \]

Next, add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests:
\[ 300 + 80 = 380 \]

Finally, divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

He sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
He sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.
The price of an MTB bike is $500, the price of a BMX bike is $500 / 2 = $250, and the price of a Trekking bike is $450.
The total earnings from Trekking bikes are 150 * $450 = $67500.
The total earnings from BMX bikes are 45 * $250 = $11250.
The total earnings from MTB bikes are 105 * $500 = $52500.
The total earnings from all bikes are $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131,250.

answer:  The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, which is:

\[ 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:

\[ 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend received a 10% discount from the original price.

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, determine the height of the second child. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

Then, determine the height of the third child. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, determine the height of the fourth child. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

1. Calculate the total number of trucks dispatched.
2. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
4. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered.

1. The total number of trucks dispatched is 20.
2. A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]
3. The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]
4. Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is \( \boxed{300} \).

answer:  Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

If she buys the bananas individually, each banana costs $0.80. The total cost for 40 bananas would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

If she buys the bananas in bunches, each bunch costs $3.00. The total cost for 10 bunches would be:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

The amount of money saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches.

answer:  First, let's determine how much money each person spent.

Maggie spent a quarter of her $60:
\[ \text{Maggie's spending} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

Riza spent one-third of her $60:
\[ \text{Riza's spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Now, let's calculate how much money each person has left.

Maggie's remaining money:
\[ \text{Maggie's remaining money} = 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza's remaining money:
\[ \text{Riza's remaining money} = 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Finally, let's find the total amount of money they have left:
\[ \text{Total remaining money} = \text{Maggie's remaining money} + \text{Riza's remaining money} = 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is \boxed{85} dollars.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of sodas left:
- Ellen started with 12 sodas.
- She took 1 unshaken soda, so there are 12 - 1 = 11 sodas left.
- Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are 11 - 1 - 2 = 8 sodas left.

Now, let's determine the number of shaken sodas left:
- Ellen initially shook 3 sodas.
- Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, so there are 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas left.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{ikelihood} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:
\[ 10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's find the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas in total, so the third monkey eats:
\[ 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

The third monkey eats:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

answer:  To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of item and then sum them up.

1. Earnings from milkshakes:
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
   - Total earnings from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $<<6*5.50=33>>33

2. Earnings from burger platters:
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
   - Total earnings from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $<<9*11=99>>99

3. Earnings from sodas:
   - Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
   - Total earnings from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $<<20*1.50=30>>30

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
- Total earnings = $33 + $99 + $30 = $<<33+99+30=162>>162

answer:  To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, Martha's age is:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

So, Jeff is 30 years old.

answer:  To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck over the 6-hour day.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer to find the number of bales left in the field:
- Total bales produced: 30
- Total bales picked up: 18
- Bales left: \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

There are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples.

answer:  Sheila's initial balance is $85.00.

She returned an item that cost $15.00, so her balance now is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

The frying pan is on sale for 20% off $20.00, so the sale price of the frying pan is:
\[ 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

The towels are on sale for 10% off $30.00, so the sale price of the towels is:
\[ 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

The total cost of the frying pan and towels is:
\[ 16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00 \]

Adding this to her current balance:
\[ 70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00 \]

Sheila's new credit card balance is $113.00.

   - Wait time: 10 minutes - 0 minutes = 10 minutes

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrival time: 30 minutes
   - Stay time: 5 minutes (quarter of 20 minutes)
   - Wait time: 30 minutes - 0 minutes = 30 minutes

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrival time: 60 minutes
   - Stay time: 0 minutes (leaves immediately)
   - Wait time: 60 minutes - 0 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrival time: 80 minutes
   - Wait time: 80 minutes - 60 minutes = 20 minutes

1. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one minute.
2. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour.
3. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by five springs in one hour.
4. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by five springs in four hours.

1. One spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.
2. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so one spring creates 60 jellyfish in one minute.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so one spring creates 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish in one hour.
4. Five springs would create 5 * 3600 = 18000 jellyfish in one hour.
5. Five springs would create 18000 * 4 = 72000 jellyfish in four hours.

Therefore, 5 springs would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second train:**
   - Speed of the second train: Half of the first train's speed, which is 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

3. **Total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance of the first train + Distance of the second train = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are **270 miles** apart from each other.

answer:  To determine Frankie's score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Binkie's score.
2. Calculate Frankie's score based on the given relationship.

Given:
- Binkie's score = 90
- Frankie's score = 15 more than twice Binkie's score

Let's calculate Frankie's score:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 180 + 15 \]

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we subtract Harry's portion from the total amount:
\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

answer:  To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest waterslide: 60 feet/minute
- Time for the biggest waterslide = Distance / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest waterslide: 80 feet/minute
- Time for the second biggest waterslide = Distance / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for the biggest waterslide - Time for the second biggest waterslide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.

answer:  First, let's determine how many miles Soledad plans to hike in a day. She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:

\[ 2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike in June. June has 30 days:

\[ 250 \times 30 = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is 9,300 miles. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike, we subtract the miles she plans to hike from her goal:

\[ 9300 - 7500 = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, to determine how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days in June:

\[ \frac{1800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles per day.

answer:  To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate of the crocodile. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.

First, let's calculate the growth rate per year:
\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{\text{Total growth}}{\text{Number of years}} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} \]

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years:
\[ \text{Total growth in 13 years} = \text{Growth rate per year} \times \text{Number of years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} \]

\[ \text{Total growth in 13 years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( x \).

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

3. According to the problem, 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{15} = 6
   \]

4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

- Normal classes per day: 6
- Extra classes per day: 2
- Total classes per day: 6 + 2 = 8

Next, calculate the total time John spends in class each day:
- Time per class: 40 minutes
- Total time per day: 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Now, calculate the total time John spends in class each week:
- Total time per week: 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes

Then, calculate the extra time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:
- Extra time per day: 1/16 * 1600 minutes = 100 minutes

Finally, calculate the total time John spends learning each week:
- Total time per week: 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time per week: 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours

answer:  First, determine the height from which the ball was initially dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and the ball was dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce. The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, calculate the height of the ball after the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball goes to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce.

answer:  To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total school population} = 240 \]

To find the total school population, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ \text{Total school population} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Now that we know the total school population is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total school population:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Total school population} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

answer:  Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, so it ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The remaining meat after the T-Rex ate is \( x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
3. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
4. The remaining meat after the velociraptors ate is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
5. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

answer:  First, let's determine the initial number of male and female fish in Tate's pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's account for the additional fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Finally, let's determine how many more female fish than male fish Tate has:

- Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16
- Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11

Difference: 16 - 11 = 5

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
- Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
- Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north wall: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet
- The south wall: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet
- The east wall: 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet
- The west wall: 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet

Next, let's find the total area of all four walls:

Total area = 80 square feet + 80 square feet + 40 square feet + 40 square feet = 240 square feet

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required to cover 240 square feet. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet:

Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

So, it will cost $144 to paint the four walls of the room.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so the total number of days is:

\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, Billy takes 10 days off. This means he works for:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. Therefore, he helps:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Over the 40 days he works, he helps:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, Billy helps 240 people.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours.

The first two workers each produce 6 toys per hour, so they produce a total of \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
The next two workers each produce 4 toys per hour, so they produce a total of \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Adding these together, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The total number of toys needed is 400, and the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced \(400 - 200 - 20 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

answer:  To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses, then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of people from the cars:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people from the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 60 \text{ people} + 420 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church.

answer:  Anna had a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left.
She bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book as \( x \).

The total cost of the two books is \( 2x \).

Anna has $2 left in her budget after buying the books, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Therefore, \( 2x = 10 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks in one day:

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:

Total time for 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours:

Total time for 5 days = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the Earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, let's find half of the circumference of the Earth:
\[ \text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. We can calculate the number of days required by dividing the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

answer:  To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Micah ran.
2. Subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find the distance Ahito ran.

First, let's calculate the distance Micah ran:
Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total distance run by Amber and Micah} = \text{Distance Amber ran} + \text{Distance Micah ran} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find the distance Ahito ran:
\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

answer:  To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and then sum these times.

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog. Therefore, Megan took:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry. Therefore, Dior took:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the times taken by all three:
\[
4 \text{ hours (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ hours (Megan)} + 8 \text{ hours (Dior)} = 18 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[
18 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the answer is 18 hours.

answer:  First, determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce per crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces per box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Add the weight of the crayons and the boxes:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

answer:  To determine how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the pots and garden soil before applying the coupon.
2. Subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost:
- The cost of the pots is $19.
- The cost of the garden soil is $26.

So, the total cost before the coupon is:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the coupon:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

answer:  Lauren's current salary is $100,000, and she plans to live with 40% of her current salary, which is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.
She plans to save for 20 years, so she needs to save a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.
Currently, she saves 20% of her paycheck, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.
To save $800,000, she needs to work for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.
Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

answer:  To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to determine the weight of each dog and then sum them up.

1. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
2. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}

answer:  To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28:
\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

1. Calculate the amount of apples Peter wants.
2. Calculate the amount of apples Paul wants.
3. Subtract the total amount wanted by Peter and Paul from the total amount of apples.

First, let's calculate how much apples Peter wants:
\[ \text{Peter's apples} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Next, let's calculate how much apples Paul wants:
\[ \text{Paul's apples} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of apples wanted by Peter and Paul:
\[ \text{Total apples wanted by Peter and Paul} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Finally, we subtract this total from the original amount of apples:
\[ \text{Jacques apples} = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

answer:  To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total height of all the heels.
2. Determine the total number of women.
3. Divide the total height by the total number of women to find the average.

1. **Total height of all the heels:**
   - Three women wearing 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
   - Three women wearing 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches
   - Total height of all heels: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

2. **Total number of women:**
   - Three women wearing 4-inch heels
   - Three women wearing 2-inch heels
   - Total number of women: \(3 + 3 = 6\)

3. **Average height of the heels:**
   - Average height = Total height of all heels / Total number of women
   - Average height = 18 inches / 6 women
   - Average height = 3 inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

answer:  To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the average car.
2. Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
3. Calculate the speed of the fastest car based on the speed of the 2nd fastest car.

1. The speed of the average car is given as 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
   \[
   5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
   \[
   1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{750 \text{ miles per hour}}
\]

answer:  To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add them to the initial number of animals.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of cows added over three weeks:**
   - Three weeks = 21 days
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
   - Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

3. **Number of chickens added over three weeks:**
   - Three weeks = 21 days
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
   - Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

4. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total animals = Initial cows + Cows added + Chickens added
   - Total animals = 50 cows + 420 cows + 210 chickens = 680 animals

Next, calculate how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 64 feet of wood:
\[ 64 \text{ feet} \div 4 \text{ feet/log} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Each log is cut into 5 planks:
\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2:
\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/ plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes $96.

4. Subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans to find the number of blue jelly beans.

1. The number of green jelly beans is given as 17.
2. The number of red jelly beans is twice the number of green jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]
3. The total number of green and red jelly beans is:
   \[
   17 + 34 = 51
   \]
4. The total number of jelly beans is 60. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:
   \[
   60 - 51 = 9
   \]

Therefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans.

answer:  To determine how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} \]
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink a total of 459 times.

1. For the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
   \[
   3 \text{ trees} \times 7 \text{ blue birds per tree} = 21 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

2. For the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
   \[

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \[
   1 \text{ tree} \times 3 \text{ blue birds} = 3 \text{ blue birds}
   \]

Now, we add the number of blue birds from all the trees:
\[
21 \text{ blue birds} + 8 \text{ blue birds} + 3 \text{ blue birds} = 32 \text{ blue birds}

answer:  First, we need to calculate the distance from John's home to his parents' house. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a month:

\[ \text{Total distance per month} = \text{Distance per trip} \times \text{Number of trips per month} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 140 \, \text{miles/trip} \times 2 \, \text{trips/month} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per month} = 280 \, \text{miles/month} \]

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents, considering the round trip.

answer:  First, determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100:
\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the rocks:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of rocks} \times \text{Cost per rock} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

Adam sells only 60% of his inventory:
\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Finally, calculate the loss:
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16.

answer:  To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days.
2. Use the information that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian to find Brian's distance.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days:
\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]
\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

To find Brian's distance, divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. #### 35

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, let's determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs:
Each pack contains 9 bagels, so for 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:
\[ \text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{36}{36} \]
\[ \text{Cost per bagel} = 1 \]

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00 after the discount.

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is \( \frac{S}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which is \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.

Since \( \frac{S}{4} \) is the number of stickers Luis gave to Kris, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

Therefore, Seth had \( 64 \) stickers.

answer:  To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his carrot consumption into weekdays and weekends and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
- He eats 4 carrots each weekday.

\[ 5 \text{ weekdays} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).
- He eats 5 carrots each weekend day.

\[ 2 \text{ weekend days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in one year.
2. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in one year.
3. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade.

First, let's calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in one year:
- Tim grows 5 trees.
- Each tree produces 6 lemons per year.

So, the number of lemons in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in a decade:
- There are 10 years in a decade.
- Tim collects 30 lemons each year.

So, the number of lemons in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:

answer:  Let's denote Vince's current age as \( V \).

Liam is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, Liam was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Now, solve for \( V \):
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]

answer:  First, calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene:

- For large-sized picture scenes:
  \[
  \text{Days for large scenes} = \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

- For medium-sized picture scenes:
  \[
  \text{Days for medium scenes} = \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

- For small-sized picture scenes:
  \[
  \text{Days for small scenes} = \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, sum the days required for all types of picture scenes:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes.

\[
\boxed{22}

answer:  Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + A + C + S = 56 \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)
3. \( C = S + 12 \)

Substitute \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) back into the third equation to find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let \( A = S = 9 \).

Now, find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 9 = 12 \]

The answer is 12

answer:  To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, each bottle covers 0.20 of a person's daily energy needs.

To cover the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 0.20 \text{ bottles/person} = 4600 \text{ bottles} \]

The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles currently produced from the total number of bottles required:
\[ 4600 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 400 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex needs to produce 400 more bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

answer:  Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they have together is $45000.

answer:  To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance Sid traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance Sid traveled:
- Distance traveled in the first part: 110 miles
- Distance traveled in the second part: 140 miles

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Time taken for the first part: 2 hours
- Time taken for the second part: 3 hours

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour.

answer:  To determine Geb's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Haley's age.
2. Calculate half of Haley's age.
3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Haley's age is 26 years old.
2. Half of Haley's age is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).
3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age: \( 13 - 10 = 3 \).

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

answer:  Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - She spends 40 minutes on the beach.

2. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
   - Let \( t \) be the time spent on the sidewalk.
   - Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is half of the time spent on the beach.
   - Therefore, \( t = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time spent on the sidewalk: 20 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes

answer:  To find the total duration of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of each song and then sum them up.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total duration of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is 13 minutes.

answer:  To find the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
5. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

The answer is 2350.

answer:  To determine how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate.
2. Determine the number of potatoes needed per scoop.
3. Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate.

First, let's find out how many scoops Gomer ate:
- Homer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are needed per scoop:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
- \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
- \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Now, we can calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:
- Homer ate 18 scoops.
- Each scoop requires 3 potatoes.
- Total potatoes = 18 scoops * 3 potatoes per scoop = 54 potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

answer:  Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle becomes:
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, he pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into the bottle, so the total temperature of the water in the bottle becomes:
\[ 132 + T \text{ degrees} \]

Since Donny can only drink water that is at least 40 degrees, the total temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ 132 + T \geq 40 \]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \) of the second mug, we solve the inequality:
\[ 132 + T \geq 40 \]
\[ T \geq 40 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq -92 \]

Thus, the temperature of the second mug must be at least -92 degrees.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue.

- There are 8 octuplets in total.
- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, let's determine how many babies wear bows.

- All 2 babies dressed in blue wear bows.
- 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, let's calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

- The number of babies dressed in purple who wear bows is 2.
- The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.

The percentage chance is \( \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \)

answer:  Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint used as \( x \) pints. According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.

Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is \( \frac{x}{2} \) pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint, which is given as 12 pints. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3x + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]

\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 12 \]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 7x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = \frac{24}{7} = 4 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 4 \) pints.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, add the eggs from both periods:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 240 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

The total number of parts in the ratio is \(5 + 9 = 14\).

To find the number of passengers per part, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

So, each part represents 6 passengers.

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9 \times 6 = 54\)

Next, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

answer:  To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in one day.
2. Calculate the number of face masks Tyrion uses in 2 days.

First, let's find out how many face masks Tyrion uses in one day:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- He goes out three times a day.

So, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ masks per outing} \times 3 \text{ outings per day} = 6 \text{ masks per day} \]

Next, let's find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- If he uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days he will use:
\[ 6 \text{ masks per day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

The final answer is:
\[\boxed{12}\]

answer:  To determine how many eggs each child receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Chatty prepared.
2. Divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs:
- Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
- One dozen equals 12 eggs.
- Therefore, three dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:
- Chatty has four children.
- So, each child receives \(36 \div 4 = 9\) eggs.

Each child receives 9 eggs.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
- Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, let's determine the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Number of sunflowers from bouquets = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.
- Total number of sunflowers sold per day = 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ bills} \]

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill is equivalent to 4 5 dollar bills:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ bills} \]

Therefore, the total number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

answer:  To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

- The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.20.
- The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely than the first ticket, so it is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

The probability that both tickets win is the product of these two probabilities:

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 0.12, or 12%.

answer:  First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
- Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet.
- Area of one bedroom = 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms:
- Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240 square feet = 960 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the area of the living room:
- The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
- Area of the living room = 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of the bedrooms and the living room:
- Total area of bedrooms and living room = 960 square feet + 1200 square feet = 2160 square feet.

Finally, let's add the area of the rest of the house:
- Total area of the house = 2160 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

answer:  To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find the number of books per school.

First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the cost per book:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \]

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

answer:  Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which is $40. Therefore, the profit per device is $40 - $20 = $20.

Last Monday, Linus bought 2 devices, so the profit from Monday is:
\[ 2 \text{ devices} \times \$20 \text{ per device} = \$40 \]

Last Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices, so the profit from Tuesday is:
\[ 4 \text{ devices} \times \$20 \text{ per device} = \$80 \]

The total profit from selling all the devices is:
\[ \$40 + \$80 = \$120 \]

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

answer:  Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as \( C \).

According to the problem, Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]
seashells.

Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:
\[ C = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]
seashells.

Now, let's calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the total number of seashells equally among the three of them. Therefore, each person gets:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]
seashells.

So, each person gets 20 seashells.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Next, let's determine the number of goals scored by each team in the second half:
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores (1/4) * 2 = 1 goal.
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:
- Team A: 4 goals in the first half + 1 goal in the second half = 5 goals.
- Team B: 2 goals in the first half + 8 goals in the second half = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 5 goals by team A + 10 goals by team B = 15 goals.

answer:  To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Ned's height:**
   - Isabel is 7 feet tall.
   - Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.
   - Therefore, Ned's height is \( 7 - 2 = 5 \) feet.

2. **Determine Carl's height:**
   - Carl is one foot taller than Ned.
   - Therefore, Carl's height is \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) feet.

3. **Determine the length of Carl's cane:**
   - Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
   - Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) feet.

So, Carl's cane is 3 feet long.

answer:  To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of reports received last week.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total reports received last week: 5168
2. Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
3. Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Next, subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining reports:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

answer:  To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed.
2. Divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

First, let's calculate the total number of teeth fixed:
- The dentist drills 4 teeth.
- The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) teeth.

Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Next, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.5 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 50 \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

answer:  Let's denote the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day as \( x \).

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages left.

On the second day, they used 30 bandages, so they had \( (x + 12) - 30 = x - 18 \) bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages, so they had \( (x - 18) + 25 = x + 7 \) bandages left.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so \( x + 7 = 78 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 7 \]
\[ x = 71 \]

Therefore, the nurses started with 71 bandages on the first day.

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, so he sold 80/4 = 20 square meters for $30.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60 from the remaining land.

In total, Abraham earned $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 from selling all his unused land.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + (B + 7) + 4B = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ centimeters} \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

answer:  First, we need to determine the amount of blood one shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate:

\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood per whale} \]

Given that one whale has 40 gallons of blood:

\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks:

\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood per shark} \]

\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton brought home:

- From the first step, he picked up 2 apples.
- From the second step, he picked up 5 apples and put 4 in his pocket, so he picked up 5 apples.
- From the third step, he picked up 6 apples.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 \text{ (step 1)} + 5 \text{ (step 2)} + 6 \text{ (step 3)} = 13 \text{ apples} \]

So, Newton brought home a total of 13 apples.

answer:  First, calculate the number of apartments in each complex:
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each: \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
- The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined: \(400 + 0.6 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Next, calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects:
- \(3 \times 1040 = 3120\) apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so his weekly earnings are:
- \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\) dollars.

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

answer:  To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts over the five days, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs as Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs as Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs as Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: Alice counts double the number of puffs as Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 \]

Therefore, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 puffs of clouds.

answer:  On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we add the number of trees planted on each day:

First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

Total trees planted = 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees

Therefore, Mr. Julius planted a total of 140 trees in the two days.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Rissa was given as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Let's denote the amount of money Rissa gave away as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave away $3. Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave away the same amount of money, Ronnie also gave away $3.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving away $3:

\[ \text{Ronnie's remaining money} = 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\).

answer:  Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, so in 60 minutes, he can build 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.
However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, 2*60/15 = 8 snowballs will melt.
Therefore, in 60 minutes, Jay will have 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.
To have 60 snowballs, Jay needs to build 60 - 12 = 48 snowballs.
Since Jay can build 1/3 snowballs per minute, it will take him 48 / (1/3) = 144 minutes to build 48 snowballs.
However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 144 minutes, 2*144/15 = 24 snowballs will melt.
Therefore, Jay will have 48 - 24 = 24 snowballs after 144 minutes.
So, it will take Jay 144 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's calculate how much chalk is left after Monday:

\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Now, let's determine how many days the remaining chalk will last:

\[ \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ inch/day}} = 2.75 \text{ days} \]

So, the teacher has 2.75 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets with six colors each:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

Adding these together, Amy initially had:
\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses:
\[ 1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ colors} \]

The number of colors left after one palette is stolen is:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

The number of colors left after using half of one makeup set is:
\[ 22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors} \]

Therefore, Amy has:
\[ \boxed{19} \] eyeshadow colors left.

answer:  To determine the total cost of May's haircut and coloring, we need to calculate both the cost of the haircut and the cost of the coloring.

1. **Cost of the haircut:**
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.
   - The reduction in hair length is \( 10 - 8 = 2 \) inches.
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the coloring:**
   - The cost of the coloring is given as $40.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the coloring.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 60 + 40 = 100 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1. The regular box costs $12, and the special size box also costs $12.

\[ \text{Number of pods for $1} = \frac{120}{12} = 10 \]

Since you need 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

answer:  To determine how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the sour milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:

Total cost = Amount of milk × Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 gallons × $3.5/gallon
Total cost = $14,000

Next, let's determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:

Amount of sour milk = (2/5) × Amount of milk
Amount of sour milk = (2/5) × 4000 gallons
Amount of sour milk = 1600 gallons

Now, let's calculate the refund amount based on the sour milk:

Refund amount = Amount of sour milk × Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 gallons × $3.5/gallon
Refund amount = $5,600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600.

answer:  To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the loan John gets.
2. Determine how much he uses to pay off his debts.
3. Subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find the leftover money.

1. Calculate the loan amount:
   \[
   \text{Lo amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   \]

2. Determine the amount used to pay off debts:
   \[
   \text{Amount used for debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   \]

3. Subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:
   \[
   \text{Leftover money} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

answer:  To determine how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many students are on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students.

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity:
   - There are 12 girls in the class.
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - There are 12 boys in the class.
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \).

3. Calculate the total number of students on varsity:
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7.

4. Calculate the number of students not on varsity:
   - Total students in the class = 24.
   - Students not on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17.

answer:  To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at each time.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80 \) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first came in, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150 \) people.

Now, we add up all these numbers:

\[ 50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (at 10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after a while)} + 150 \text{ (by evening)} = 320 \]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

\[ \boxed 320 \]

answer:  To determine the total cost of Ali's order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Determine the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags} = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ali's order will cost $306.

answer:  Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \).

According to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Wendy will be seven years from now. Therefore, Wendy's current age is:
\[ 5(C + 7) \]

We are also told that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, in 25 years, Wendy's age will be:
\[ 5(C + 7) + 25 = 5C + 60 \]

And in 25 years, Colin's age will be:
\[ C + 25 \]

According to the problem, this will be a third of Wendy's current age:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times (5C + 60) \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 60 \]
\[ 3C - 2C = 75 - 60 \]
\[ C = 15 \]

So, Colin is currently \( 15 \) years old.

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes required for all the children.
2. Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes.
3. Subtract the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many diapers Jordan changes.

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children.
   \[
   5 \text{ diaper changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ diaper changes/day}
   \]

2. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day}
   \]

3. Subtract the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes from the total number of diaper changes.
   \[
   10 \text{ diaper changes/day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day}
   \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
   - His children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons.

4. **Fourth Day:**
   - There are 3 people at the party.
   - They share the remaining root beer equally.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons.

So, each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons of root beer.

\[ \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, each person will have approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

answer:  To determine Jim's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
2. Calculate the age difference between John and Jim when Digimon came out.
3. Use the age difference to find Jim's age.

First, we know that John is currently 28 years old. Digimon came out 20 years ago, so John's age when Digimon came out was:
\[ 28 - 20 = 8 \]

Next, we know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out. According to the problem:
\[ 8 = 2J \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, Jim's current age is:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

\( \boxed{24} \)

answer:  To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required for her 6 friends.

Each friend eats:
- 6 cheese pizza slices
- 4 pepperoni pizza slices

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices needed:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, add the total number of cheese and pepperoni slices:
\[ 36 \text{ slices} + 24 \text{ slices} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many pizzas are required:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 5 cheese pizza pies.

answer:  To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups are needed to accommodate all the students.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups.

1. **Total number of students:**
   - There are 4 grades (grades 4-7).
   - Each grade sends 10 students to try the escape room.
   - Total number of students = 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students.

2. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Each group can accommodate 8 students.
   - Number of groups = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

3. **Total time required:**
   - Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room.
   - Total time = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 225 minutes.

answer:  Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the second floor plus the height of the first floor (since the roof is above the second floor and above the first floor):

\[ 240 + 180 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 420 inches.

answer:  First, calculate Jen's weekly earnings:
- She works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Weekly earnings = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = $67.5/week

Next, calculate Jen's monthly earnings:
- There are 4 weeks in April.

Monthly earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Monthly earnings = $67.5/week * 4 weeks
Monthly earnings = $270

Finally, add the additional $10 for complete attendance:
Total earnings = Monthly earnings + $10
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

Therefore, Jen will receive $280 for April.

answer:  To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of all three tunas.
2. Multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
- The cost per kilogram is $0.50.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market.

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens to get the total number of pens.

First, let's calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the number of red pens is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.
- Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to get the total number of pens:
- Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
- Total number of pens = 25 + 50 = 75

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.

- Emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 per time = $3.00
- Doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 per time = $3.00
- Taking the trash: 2 times * $0.75 per time = $1.50
- Cleaning his room: 1 time * $1.50 per time = $1.50

Now, let's sum up his weekly earnings:

Total weekly earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Since Jason worked over a two-week period, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

Total earnings = $9.00 * 2 = $18.00

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure without the discount:

- Basic Manicure: $35
- Basic Pedicure: $40

Total cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both the manicure and pedicure:

Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art for each of her fingers:

- Nail art per nail: $3
- Number of nails: 10 (assuming she has 10 fingers)

Total cost for nail art: $3/nail * 10 nails = $30

Finally, we add the total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art:

Total cost: $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $90.

Given:
- Saanvi needs to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.

First, calculate the amount of the second medicine in one dosage:
\[ \text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of medicine in one dosage:
\[ \text{Total medicine per dosage} = 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ \text{Total medicine in 8 doses} = 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:

answer:  Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

answer:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $<<600/10=60>>60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost for the scotch is 10 bottles * $60 = $<<10*60=600>>600.

The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $<<20*90=1800>>1800.

Therefore, the total cost for everything is $600 + $1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400.

answer:  First, calculate Charlie's reduced rate for veteran lessons. His standard rate is $80 per hour, and he reduces this rate by 25% for veterans:

\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the earnings from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from veteran lessons} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total earnings for the day:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \boxed{440} \] dollars

answer:  First, calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:
\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]
So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, determine the number of shells remaining after the Alphas found their shells:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]
So, 420 shells are remaining.

Then, calculate the number of shells found by team The finders. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]
So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells:
\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]
So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

answer:  First, let's calculate the volume of the jar:
Volume = length * width * height = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

Next, let's calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
Number of jelly beans = Volume / Volume of one jelly bean = 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 3600 jelly beans

Now, let's account for the packing efficiency:
Adjusted jelly beans = Number of jelly beans * Efficiency = 3600 jelly beans * 0.80 = 2880 jelly beans

Finally, let's estimate the number of red jelly beans:
Estimated red jelly beans = Adjusted jelly beans * Percentage of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 jelly beans

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:
Difference = 900 jelly beans - 864 jelly beans = 36 jelly beans

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we find the number of fish remaining after accounting for the fish with red stripes:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is \boxed{42}.

answer:  To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price:

The selling price is \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the cost price. The cost price is $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we subtract the cost price from the selling price to find the profit:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

answer:  To determine how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to use the information given: she wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of novels she wrote last year is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the number of novels she has written this year. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Calculating the left side:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

\( \boxed{12} \)

answer:  To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each wooden table costs $20.
- Total cost for wooden tables = 4 tables * $20/table = $<<4*20=80>>80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Total cost for roof frames = 2 frames * $10/frame = $<<2*10=20>>20.

Now, we add the total cost of the wooden tables and the total cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total amount = Total cost for wooden tables + Total cost for roof frames
- Total amount = $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100 for the work done.

answer:  To determine how many miles the last dog needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles walked by all four dogs per day and then subtract the known miles walked by the first three dogs.

The average number of miles walked per day by the four dogs is given as 3 miles. Therefore, the total number of miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find the miles needed by the last dog:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

answer:  To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we first need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to an annual cost.

1. **Weekly Cost:**
   - Pasta: $1.00 per box
   - Cheddar cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyere cheese: Twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\)

   Total weekly cost:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. **Annual Cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

   Total annual cost:
   \[
   10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
   \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - Each of John's classes has a capacity that is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class.
   - Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
     \]
   - Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacity of Ali's school and the capacity of John's school:
     \[
     120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
     \]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is \( 150 \).

answer:  To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break down the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. Calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - Cost per minute: $0.25
   - Number of minutes: 16
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes: $0.25/minute * 16 minutes = $4

2. Calculate the cost for the remaining 20 minutes:
   - Cost per minute: $0.2
   - Number of minutes: 20
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes: $0.2/minute * 20 minutes = $4

3. Add the costs of both segments to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4 + $4 = $8

Therefore, a 36-minute call would cost $8.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 1 liter
   - Days used: 3 days
   - Total water removed at low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 2 liters (twice the low setting)
   - Days used: 3 days
   - Total water removed at medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

3. **High setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 4 liters (twice the medium setting)
   - Days used: 5 days
   - Total water removed at high setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we sum the water removed at each speed:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

The total amount of water removed is 29 liters.

answer:  Let's determine the number of white hats Skyler has step by step.

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats.

2. **Red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after accounting for the red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White hats**: The rest of the hats are white.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

answer:  To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

Since each issue is part of a magazine, we need to convert the total number of issues back into magazines:
\[
66 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ magazines}
\]

Therefore, Susan receives \(\boxed{66}\) magazines every year.

answer:  When the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total number of people on the bus to 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. So, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus. This brings the total number of people on the bus to 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, 2 * 90 = 180 people entered the bus. This brings the total number of people on the bus to 90 + 180 = 270.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. The current number of people on the bus is 270. Therefore, the remaining spaces on the bus are 270 - 200 = 70.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 70.

answer:  Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. First, let's calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to repay is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. Let's calculate how much he will pay in those 11 months:

\[ \text{Amount Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount after 11 months is:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Stephen will pay this remaining amount in the twelfth month:

\[ \text{Amount to Pay in the Twelfth Month} = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

Final answer:

\[ \boxed{31} \]

answer:  To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in four years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game.

First, let's calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years:
- She plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we multiply the total number of games by the points she scores per game:
- She scores 21 points per game.

So, the total number of points is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ 3360 \text{ points} \]

answer:  Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the length of the shorter piece, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

\[ \boxed{32} \]

- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- The cost of one visit is $2.
- For 5 years, she makes 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits.
- The total cost for the first 5 years is 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:
- After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
- The new cost of one visit is $2 + (1.5 * $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.
- For the next 3 years, she makes 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits.
- The total cost for the next 3 years is 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits:
- Total cost = $30 (first 5 years) + $45 (next 3 years) = $75.

Next, calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:
\[ \text{Total time with new varnish} = 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, find the difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total time with new varnish} - \text{Total time with old varnish} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry than it would with the old varnish.

answer:  To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he travels for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the total distance Michael has traveled:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

answer:  To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs.
2. Determine the amount of seasoning needed based on the pounds of ground beef.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs. Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs per pound, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, we multiply the number of pounds of ground beef by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[ \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

answer:  Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has \( (K + 8) - 12 = K - 4 \) paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time the custodian needs to clean all the classrooms.

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, and there are 80 classrooms:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} \times 80 \text{ classrooms} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's determine the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms:
\[ \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{40 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, on average, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning the classrooms.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \).

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones. The cost of the main phone is given as $20, and the cost of the four additional phones is \( 4x \).

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ 20 + 4x \]

We know that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so:
\[ 20 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the whole phone plan:
\[ 20 + 4 \times 10 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the whole phone plan costs $60.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies is \( 3C - 2 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is \( C + (3C - 2) = 4C - 2 \).

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

To find \( C \), we solve the equation:
1. Add 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4C}{4} = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes. #### 3

answer:  To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the original number of pomelos Eve had.
2. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve has left after giving some away.
3. Subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number of pomelos to find out how many she gave away.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Eve originally had 20 pomelos.
2. After giving some away, Eve is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her original pomelos. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   Therefore, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.
3. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number of pomelos:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is \( \boxed{15} \).

answer:  To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the bag of beef jerky.
2. Determine the cost per stick of beef jerky.
3. Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.

1. **Discounted Price:**
   - The original price of the bag is $18.00.
   - The discount is $3.00.
   - Therefore, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

2. **Cost per Stick:**
   - The bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky.
   - The cost per stick is $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.

3. **Convert to Cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, $0.50 is equal to 0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

Therefore, each stick of beef jerky will cost 50 cents.

answer:  John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

First, calculate his new speed:
\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, determine the total number of words he needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:
\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, calculate the time it takes for him to speak 4500 words at his new speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, John would take 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

1. Calculate the price in December.
2. Calculate the price in January.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December**

The price in November is $40. In December, the price increased by 80%.

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + (0.80 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 \]
\[ \text{Price in December} = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January**

The price in December is $72. In January, the price decreased by 50%.

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - (0.50 \times 72) \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 36 \]

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. So, her brother used \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.
3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, so for 4 pies, their mother used \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) grapes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother:
- Madeline used 6 grapes.
- Her brother used 30 grapes.
- Their mother used 48 grapes.

Total grapes used = \( 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \) grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes used to the remaining grapes:
- Total grapes at the beginning = \( 84 + 0 \) remaining grapes = \( 84 \) grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

\]

After eating 24 apples, the number of apples remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples left is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold these remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. Therefore, the total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money Walter received is:

\[

- A German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- A Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.

Next, let's calculate the total daily consumption for all the dogs:

- There are 3 German Shepherds, so they consume \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs, so they consume \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) kilograms of dog food per day.

Adding these together gives the total daily consumption:

\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the weekly consumption. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

\[ 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg/week} \]

Therefore, the Kennel house will need **147 kilograms** of dog food in a week.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles.

2. **Dropped marbles**: He drops half of his marbles. Since he has 10 marbles, half of them is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ marbles}
   \]
   So, after dropping 5 marbles, he has:
   \[
   10 - 5 = 5 \text{ marbles}
   \]

3. **Marbles picked up**: He then picks up 3 more marbles. Adding these to the remaining 5 marbles, he has:
   \[
   5 + 3 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Non-marble**: One of the items he picked up was not a marble, but a bead. Since he got rid of this bead, the number of marbles he ends up with is:
   \[
   8 - 1 = 7 \text{ marbles}
   \]

Therefore, Brendan ends up with 7 marbles.

answer:  To determine the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

1. Total number of teachers: 82
2. Number of teachers who were sick: 13
3. Number of substitute teachers: 9

First, subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, add the number of substitute teachers:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, there were 78 teachers at school that day.

answer:  To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and then sum them up.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we add up the times for all six sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

answer:  First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:
- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookshelf:
- The two middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- The bottom shelf: 20 books
- The top shelf: 15 books

Total capacity of one bookshelf:
\[ 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookshelf:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her 110 books.

\[ \text{Depreciation for the first year} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \]
\[ \text{Value after the first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \]

Next, calculate the depreciation for the second year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the second year} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \]
\[ \text{Value after the second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \]

Finally, calculate the depreciation for the third year:
\[ \text{Depreciation for the third year} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \]
\[ \text{Value after the third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528 \]

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

answer:  To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the adult tickets, the cost of the child ticket, and the cost of the popcorns.

1. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 parents:
   \[
   \text{Cost of adult tickets} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

2. The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child:
   \[
   \text{Cost of child ticket} = 1 \times 8 = 8
   \]

3. The cost of one popcorn is $3, and they buy 2 popcorns:
   \[
   \text{Cost of popcorns} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of adult tickets} + \text{Cost of child ticket} + \text{Cost of popcorns} = 24 + 8 + 6 = 38
\]

Therefore, the total amount paid is $38.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per set}} = 20 \text{ sets} \]
\[ 20 \text{ sets} \times \$1 \text{ per set} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Rose's profit is \$8.00.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
   \[
   4 \text{ plants} \times 0.5 \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. For the remaining 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

Now, add up the amounts of water needed for all the plants:
\[
2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants every day.

answer:  First, let's calculate the number of questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

So, Audrey answered 42 questions correctly on the first test.

Next, let's determine the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to achieve a 70% score on both tests combined.

The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To achieve a 70% score, she needs to answer:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total.

Since she already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

answer:  To find the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny.
2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells.

First, let's find the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny:

- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:

- There were 67 cracked seashells.

Good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells = 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells found is 665.

answer:  To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to buy 15 cars:**
   - For every two customers, one buys a car.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, one person comes into the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \( 30 \times 25 = 750 \) telephone calls.

answer:  To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of doughnuts Derrick makes each day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

First, let's find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes each day:
- Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- 1 dozen = 12 doughnuts.
- Therefore, 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, we need to know the number of days in June:
- June has 30 days.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts:
- Each doughnut is sold for $2.
- Total revenue per day = 120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut = $240/day.
- Total revenue for June = $240/day * 30 days = $7200.

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June by selling all the doughnuts.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs per guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, subtract the number of hot dogs John already has:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, so calculate the number of packs needed:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs per pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

answer:  First, calculate the total number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people, so each person has 1 flashlight.
- There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights.

Total flashlights = 4 people * 2 flashlights/room * 8 rooms = 64 flashlights

Next, calculate the total number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in total.
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 8/2 = 4 rooms with small candles.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 8/2 = 4 rooms with medium candles.

Total small candles = 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles
Total medium candles = 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles

Total candles = 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Finally, add the total number of flashlights and candles:
Total candles and flashlights = 64 flashlights + 36 candles = 100 items

answer:  To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to find the number of helmets, robots, and footballs and then sum them up.

1. **Number of helmets:**
   Dominick saw 20 helmets.

2. **Number of robots:**
   Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Number of footballs:**
   Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total number of items:**
   To find the total number of items, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs:
   \[
   20 \text{ (helmets)} + 10 \text{ (robots)} + 40 \text{ (footballs)} = 70
   \]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.

1. **First day:**
   - Number of people: 50

2. **Second day:**
   - Number of people: 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Third day:**
   - Number of people: 2 * 70 = 140

4. **Fourth day:**
   - Number of people: 60

5. **Fifth day:**
   - Number of people: 60

6. **Sixth day:**
   - Number of people: 60

7. **Seventh day:**
   - Number of people: 60

Now, we sum up the number of people each day:

\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 540 \]

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \( 540 \).

answer:  First, let's determine the value of each type of coin in cents:

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total value of each type of coin:

- The value of one quarter is 25 cents.
- The value of two nickels is 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.
- The value of seven dimes is 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Finally, we add up the values of all the coins to find the total amount of money James has:

- 25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents.

So, James has 105 cents.

answer:  To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by each type of animal and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 2-legged animals.
- Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 4-legged animals.
- Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to find the total number of legs:
- Total legs = 20 (from 2-legged animals) + 60 (from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs.

So, the total number of pairs of legs on the farm is 80.

answer:  First, calculate the distance Phineas needs to travel on land and the distance he needs to travel in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we divide the total distance by 2:

- Distance on land: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
- Distance in water: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, calculate the time it takes to travel each distance:

- Time to hop on land: Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes
- Time to swim in water: Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, add the time for hopping on land and the time for swimming in water to find the total time to return home:

- Total time = Time to hop on land + Time to swim in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

The answer is 15.

answer:  First, calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12 seeds:

\[ 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ seeds/dozen} = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 \text{ seeds} = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the number of seeds in a large sunflower is:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, add the number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers to find the total number of sunflower seeds:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 54 \text{ seeds} = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is 90 seeds.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of orange candies. Since there are 54 red candies, the number of orange candies is twice that amount:
\[ \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108 \]

Next, let's determine the number of yellow candies. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies:
\[ \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies that are either red, orange, or yellow:
\[ \text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[ \text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43 \]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43.

answer:  To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks.

First, let's find the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs:
\[ 56 \text{ popsicle sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:
\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks per box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so:
\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars.

answer:  To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade uploads in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day:
- Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

So, the number of photos uploaded in one day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos:
- Jade has 210 photos in total.
- She uploads 42 photos each day.

So, the number of days required is:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos.

answer:  First, let's calculate the weekly cost for each type of clothing:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00 per week

Next, let's calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:
$47.00 per week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

answer:  Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he pays for only one T-shirt at the full price of $8, and the second T-shirt is 50% off.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8, so the discount on the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \]

Therefore, the price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

The total cost for the T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Jake also buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40, so the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]

Therefore, the price of the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

answer:  To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.

1. The weight of the car is 1200 pounds.
2. The weight of the luggage is 250 pounds.
3. Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) pounds.

Adding these together, the total weight of the car and its contents is:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01 (since 1% is the same as 0.01):
\[ 1600 \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels popped.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount popped, so \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds popped, so \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels popped.
5. After the pan is turned off, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped, so \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) kernels popped.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, Garrett has to eat 210 pieces of popcorn.

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ place settings} \]

Next, calculate the cost of each place setting:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Bowl: $5.00
- Salad plate: $4.00

Total cost per place setting:
\[ 6.00 + 5.00 + 4.00 = 15.00 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 place settings:
\[ 4 \times 15.00 = 60.00 \]

Therefore, Avery will spend $60.00 on place settings.

2. Calculate the number of yellow blocks.
3. Find the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
4. Subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The number of blue blocks is given as 4.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. The total number of blue and yellow blocks is:
   \[
   4 + 8 = 12
   \]
4. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
   \[
   32 - 12 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is \boxed{20}.

Next, we know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, for 4 cups of juice:

\[ 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Now, let's consider the extra gallon for Allen, which is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice:

\[ 1 \text{ gallon} \times 2 \text{ cups/gallon} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Again, since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice:

\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons} \]

answer:  To determine the total cost Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stays and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of hotel stays:**
   - Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights.
   - One night at the hotel costs $80.
   - Total cost for hotel stays: \( 3 nights * $80/night = $240 \).

2. **Cost of bus trips:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - 10% of $80 is \( 0.10 * $80 = $8 \).
   - Total cost for bus trips: \( 7 trips * $8/trip = $56 \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of hotel stays + Cost of bus trips
   - Total cost = $240 + $56 = $296

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

answer:  To determine how far Elvis is from his house now, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point:
- Distance from house = √((Distance west)^2 + (Distance east)^2)
- Distance from house = √(90^2 + 144^2)
- Distance from house = √(8100 + 20736)
- Distance from house = √28836
- Distance from house ≈ 169.99 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is approximately 169.99 miles from his house.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of test tubes and Petri dishes Igor actually gathered:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered before he lost any beakers:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: \( x \) (let's find this out)
- Petri dishes: 16

Total items before loss: \( 8 + x + 16 = 24 + x \)

We know that the total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29:

\[ 24 + x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor originally lost \( 7 - 5 = 2 \) beakers.

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

\[ \text{Age of the older brother} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, we know that all three sisters are 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is:

\[ \text{Total age of sisters} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the total age of the brothers. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and the older brother is 24 years old. Therefore, the total age of the brothers is:

\[ \text{Total age of brothers} = 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers to find the total age of all siblings:

\[ \text{Total age of all siblings} = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

answer:  To determine how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

2. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

3. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) minutes per mile.

4. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{8}{2} = 16 \) minutes per mile.

5. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile.
   - Therefore, Vanessa took \( 4 \times 16 = 64 \) minutes.

2. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas dropped from the total number of marbles he had.
3. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas has now from the total number of marbles Mazie had to find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, then:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]
So, Dallas had 25 marbles before dropping any.

Next, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles in total. If Dallas received 25 marbles, then the number of marbles Darla received is:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

answer:  To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. We know that Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age, and Mia is currently 40 years old.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we calculate the average of their ages:

Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average = (40 + 56) / 2
Average = 96 / 2
Average = 48

So, the average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.
2. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, let's determine John's current age.

1. John had James when he was 19, and James is currently 18 years old.
2. Therefore, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, let's determine the age of John's youngest son.

1. John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
2. John is currently 37 years old.
3. Therefore, John's youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

1. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of children:**
   - There are 5 children following the truck at the end of the first street.

2. **On the second street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by one more child.
   - Therefore, the total number of children becomes \( 5 + 5 = 10 \).

3. **On the third street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - Therefore, the total number of children becomes \( 10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 \).

4. **After the original 5 children give up and leave:**
   - The original 5 children give up and leave the group.
   - Therefore, the number of children remaining following the truck is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

So, the number of children now following the truck is 25.

Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one ticket:

\[ \frac{13}{6.50} \approx 2.0769 \]

Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Ryan can buy:

\[ 2 \text{ movie tickets} \]

Answer: 2 movie tickets.

answer:  First, determine the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of people sharing the pizzas:
\[ 1 \text{ Henry} + 3 \text{ friends} = 4 \text{ people} \]

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of feed each pig eats in a day:
Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of feed all five pigs eat in a day:
\[ 5 \text{ pigs} \times 8 \text{ pounds/pig/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, calculate the total amount of feed all five pigs eat in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Finally, subtract the total amount of feed consumed in a week from the total amount of feed ordered:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the amount of feed left after a week is:
\[ 20 \text{ pounds} \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each * 2 tickets = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spending = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Next, let's subtract the total spending from the amount she received from her parents:

- Amount received from parents: $40
- Total spending: $27.00

Amount left = $40 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left.

answer:  First, calculate the total time Charisma spends meditating in a week:
- She meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- In a week, there are 7 days, so 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Next, calculate the total time Charisma spends on yoga in a week:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
- She practices yoga 5 days a week, so 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in a week:
- Total weekly meditation/yoga time = 210 minutes/week + 300 minutes/week = 510 minutes/week.

Finally, calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks:
- Total meditation/yoga time in 4 weeks = 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma spends 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of meals Mamou has already given out:

- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Next, subtract the number of meals given out from the total number of meals she needs to distribute:

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 142

Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine the net number of holes filled per day:

- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate fills in 9 holes per day.

The net number of holes filled per day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Finally, let's convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

answer:  To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Anne's current height.
2. Determine Jackie's current height.
3. Subtract the growth over the summer from Jackie's current height to find her height before the summer.

**Step 1: Determine Anne's current height.**
Albert is 36 inches tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert.
\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine Jackie's current height.**
Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne.
\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 3: Subtract the growth over the summer from Jackie's current height to find her height before the summer.**
Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

Next, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Then, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Finally, add up all the fabric from all the t-shirts to find the total amount of fabric used for the quilt:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the quilt is \( \boxed{101} \) square feet.

answer:  To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all 4 tables.
2. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.

First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
  \[
  4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table}
  \]
- Since there are 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
  \[
  8 \text{ screws/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 32 \text{ screws}
  \]

Next, subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has:
\[
40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}
\]

Therefore, James will have **8 screws** left over.

answer:  To determine how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week.
2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars.

First, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week:
- The company produces 5000 bars per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in one week, the company produces \( 5000 \times 7 = 35000 \) bars.

Next, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks:
- In two weeks, the company produces \( 35000 \times 2 = 70000 \) bars.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars:
- Each chocolate bar is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 70000 \times 2 = 140000 \) dollars.

answer:  To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line required for the entire dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total line required.

First, let's calculate the total amount of line required:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.

So, the total amount of line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total line required:
- The caretaker already has 6 feet of line.

So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet required} - 6 \text{ feet he already has} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line.

answer:  First, calculate the cost of each ingredient for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Next, calculate the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 jars * $44/jar = $440

Then, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
- Total revenue for 10 jars = 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue for 10 jars - Total cost for 10 jars
- Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars.

answer:  To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings for 2 weeks.

1. Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. Therefore, he is open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. That's 5 days a week.

2. Josh services 3 cars each day. So, in a week, he services 5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars.

3. Josh gets paid $4 per car. Therefore, his weekly earnings are 15 cars * $4/car = $60.

4. To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

answer:  To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, Ana can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges in an hour.

Next, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges in an hour.

Now, we calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\).

He eats 3 cookies for an early-day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3
- Sugar cookies: 4

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2
- Oatmeal cookies: 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, Randy has 10 oatmeal + 7 chocolate chip cookies + 6 sugar cookies = 23 cookies.

answer:  To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School.

First, let's find the average enrollment at Butler High School:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is \(\boxed{1000}\) greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750

   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by all three girls:
\[
\text{Total amount raised} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} = 430 + 750 + 700 = 1880

answer:  To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue per reservation.
2. Calculate the total revenue per night.
3. Calculate the total revenue per week.

First, let's calculate the total revenue per reservation:
- Each reservation consists of 2 meals at $5 each: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
- Each reservation also includes 1 bottle of wine at $5: \( 1 \times 5 = 5 \)
- Therefore, the total revenue per reservation is: \( 10 + 5 = 15 \)

Next, let's calculate the total revenue per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- Therefore, the total revenue per night is: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- Therefore, the total revenue per week is: \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \)

So, Tom's restaurant makes $180 a week. #### 180

answer:  First, we need to determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we calculate the profit per watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price per watermelon:

\[ \text{Profit per watermelon} = 0.25 \times 1.60 = \$0.40 \]

Now, we find the selling price per watermelon by adding the profit to the cost price per watermelon:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

Finally, add the discounted price of the radiator to the installation cost to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, Mark paid $230.

====================
answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + k = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4k = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
c + k = 20
\]
\[
c + 2k = 35
\]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
k = 15
\]

Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

So, there are 5 chickens.
\boxed{5}
