answer:  The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. 

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Next, add the amounts of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:
\[ \text{Total bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the robe takes a total of 3 bolts.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost Josh incurred:
- He bought the house for $80,000.
- He spent $50,000 on repairs.

Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Next, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs:
- The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
- The original value of the house was $80,000.

Increase in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.

New value of the house = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = New value - Total cost

Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

answer:  To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the distance James runs in one day.
3. Calculate the distance James runs in one week.

First, let's calculate the distance James runs in one sprint:
- James runs 60 meters each sprint.

Next, let's calculate the distance James runs in one day:
- James runs 3 sprints each day.
- Therefore, the distance he runs in one day is:
  \[
  3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the distance James runs in one week:
- James runs 3 times a week.
- Therefore, the distance he runs in one week is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 180 \text{ meters/day} = 540 \text{ meters}
  \]

So, James runs 540 meters in a week.

answer:  To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends.
3. Calculate the number of eggs left to sell.
4. Multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to find the daily earnings.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends. So, she eats a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.
3. The number of eggs left to sell is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs eaten: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.
4. Janet sells each egg for $2. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs are 9 eggs * $2/egg = $<<9*2=18>>18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we need to calculate the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep from each city to find the total:

- Seattle's sheep: 20
- Charleston's sheep: 80
- Toulouse's sheep: 160

Total number of sheep = \( 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \)

Thus, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together.

**Answer: 260**

answer:  To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses and the cost of the next 8 glasses separately.

1. **Cost of the first 8 glasses:**
   - Each glass costs $5.
   - Total cost for the first 8 glasses: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the next 8 glasses:**
   - Every second glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass.
   - Cost of each second glass: \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for the next 8 glasses: \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 16 glasses:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first 8 glasses + Cost of the next 8 glasses
   - Total cost = \( 40 + 24 = 64 \) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

answer:  First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file.

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 80 GB is:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB

Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so the time to download 120 GB is:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the restart and the download time:

40 minutes (first part) + 60 minutes (second part) + 20 minutes (restart) = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

answer:  To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for all the chickens in a day.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens. Therefore, the total amount of feed required in a day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals:
- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

Adding these together:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the amount given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total required for the day:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens **20 cups** of feed in the final meal of the day.

answer:  To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads: 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - Downloads: Three times as many as the first month
   - Downloads: \(3 \times 60 = 180\)

3. **Third Month:**
   - Downloads: Reduced by 30% from the second month
   - Reduction: \(30\% \times 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54\)
   - Downloads: \(180 - 54 = 126\)

Now, we sum up the downloads for all three months:

- First Month: 60 downloads
- Second Month: 180 downloads
- Third Month: 126 downloads

Total downloads: \(60 + 180 + 126 = 366\)

Therefore, the program had a total of \(366\) downloads over the three months.

answer:  Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours is $10 per hour, so she earns 40 * $10 = $<<40*10=400>>400 for her regular hours.

Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10 = $<<1.2*10=12>>12 per hour.

Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, so she worked 45 - 40 = <<45-40=5>>5 overtime hours.

Her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $<<5*12=60>>60.

Therefore, her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460.

answer:  First, let's calculate the distance John covers during the first part of his trip:
- He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance he covers during the second part of his trip:
- He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

Then, let's calculate the distance he covers during the third part of his trip:
- He drives for 1 hour at 80 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance he has traveled:
- Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 80 miles = 275 miles.

Since he turned around and returned home, he is back at home after 4 hours. Therefore, his distance from home at the end of those 4 hours is 0 miles.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for the contemporary dance students:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Then, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

Now, we calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

Finally, we determine the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

answer:  To determine the profit from each purchase plan, we need to calculate the new value of each item after the market increase and then subtract the original cost.

**Jewelry:**
- Original cost: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- New value: $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
- Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

**Electronic Gadgets:**
- Original cost: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- New value: $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
- Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the purchase plan that yields the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry is $125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96.

Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry purchase plan, which will yield a profit of $125.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house, so she had \( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{6} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners.

After these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \):

\[ \frac{x}{6} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \frac{x}{6} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 6 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week:
- Claire eats 3 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks:
- If she eats 21 eggs per week, then in 4 weeks she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Finally, let's convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Therefore, 84 eggs is equal to 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

answer:  To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year:
- Each year, Carlos sells 7 lemons at $1.5 each, so he earns \( 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \) dollars.
- It costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year.
- Therefore, the net profit per year is \( 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:
- The initial cost of planting the tree is $90.
- The net profit per year is $7.5.
- To find the number of years, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: \( \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \) years.

Therefore, Carlos will start earning money from the lemon tree in 2 years.

- Amount of water in orange drink = 10 liters * (2/3) = 6 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- 15 liters of pineapple drink are three-fifths water.
- Amount of water in pineapple drink = 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the combined mixture:

- Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the remaining orange drink is 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters.

The total volume of the remaining mixture is 9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink = 24 liters.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the same as the total water in the combined mixture, which is 15 liters.

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:

\[ \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20 jelly beans. So, the third friend's guess is 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240 jelly beans.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

The discount is 25% of the original price, so the price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 19.50 \times \frac{1}{0.75} = 19.50 \times 4/3 = 26 \]

On the second day, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
On the third day, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Adding these up, the total hours he runs in a week is:

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles a week. To find his running speed, we use the formula:

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} \]

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

- Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Now, we add the points from both periods:
- Points in the first 20 minutes: 4 points
- Points in the second 20 minutes: 5 points

Total points: \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

answer:  To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between the two stops.

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. The first stop was after 20 miles.
3. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, let's find the distance from the start of the trip to the first stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance from the start to the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Henry traveled **20 miles** between his first and second stops.

answer:  To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of pie that were initially cut.
2. Subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of pie:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is 26.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is:
\[ \$195 + \$160 + \$5 = \$360 \]

Since he made \$195 from selling his lego sets, the remaining money he has from selling lego sets is:
\[ \$360 - \$195 = \$65 \]

Each lego set is sold for $15, so the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{\$65}{\$15} = \frac{65}{15} = 4 \]

Therefore, John still has 4 lego sets.

answer:  If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
If she can run at 6 miles per hour, then her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
If she spends one-third of the time running, then she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running.
If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, then she spends 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.
In 2 hours, she can travel 6 * 2 = 12 miles running.
In 4 hours, she can travel 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles walking.
Therefore, in six hours, she can travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

answer:  To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs.
2. Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week to get the weekly time.

First, let's calculate the total daily time spent taking care of all the dogs:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
- John takes care of 10 dogs.

So, the total daily time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week to get the weekly time:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total weekly time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

Each serving contains 250 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can consume if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, you can eat:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams per serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the total number of Post-it notes she had.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had remaining from the result to find the number of Post-it notes in the package.

Let's start with the first step:
Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.

Next, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the total number of Post-it notes she had:
\[ 80 - 220 = -140 \]
This means she was short 140 Post-it notes.

Finally, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she had remaining from the result:
\[ -140 - 23 = -163 \]
This means she purchased 163 Post-it notes to make up for the shortage.

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when not holding the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the gem gemstone.
3. Determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames this new distance is.

1. Polly can throw the gold javelin for 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, she can throw it for \( 3 \times 400 = 1200 \) feet.
3. The dragon's flames have a reach of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach Polly can stand, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin:

answer:  First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought. He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the red ties.

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

answer:  To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week:
- Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs produced per week is 252 eggs/day * 7 days = 1764 eggs.

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- So, the total number of dozens is 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 142 dozens.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
- Therefore, the total revenue is 142 dozens * $2/dozen = $284.

So, Lloyd makes $284 from the sale of eggs per week.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

answer:  Aleena paid $140 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months.
So, she paid $140 x 6 = $<<140*6=840>>840 for the first half of the year.
For the second half of the year, she was charged 10% less than $140 per month.
10% of $140 is $140 x 0.10 = $<<140*0.10=14>>14.
So, she paid $140 - $14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 per month for the second half of the year.
Therefore, she paid $126 x 6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the second half of the year.
In total, Aleena paid $840 + $756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

answer:  To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years separately.

1. For the first 20 years, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $100,000

2. For the remaining 10 years, Marcy receives 5% of the total pension per year.
   - Total pension for the remaining 10 years = 5% of $100,000 * 10 years = $5,000/year

Now, we add the total pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years to get the total pension over 30 years:
- Total pension = $100,000 + $5,000 = $105,000

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $105,000.

answer:  To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - There are 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies is:
     \[
     175 - 35 = 140
     \]

3. **Emeralds:**
   - There are twice the number of emeralds than rubies.
   - Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
     \[
     2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

Now, we add the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
\]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is:

answer:  To determine the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

1. **Bad oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.
2. **Unripe oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. Since there are 25 oranges in total, 20% of 25 is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.
3. **Sour oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

Next, we add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[
25 - 8 = 17
\]

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.

answer:  To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. The cost of the material: $500
2. The cost for the jeweler to construct the brooch: $800
3. The insurance cost: 10% of the total cost of the brooch

First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:
\[ \text{Total cost before insurance} = 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate the insurance cost:
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of players and coaches sent per school:

1. Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players.
2. Therefore, each school has 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.
3. Each school also has a coach for each team, so each school has 2 teams * 1 coach/team = 2 coaches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people sent by one school:

- Players per school: 10
- Coaches per school: 2
- Total people per school: 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are four schools, we multiply the total number of people per school by the number of schools:

- Total people per school: 12
- Number of schools: 4
- Total people sent by all schools: 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week.

1. Jim does this 3 times a week.

answer:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of gas used to travel 100 miles.
2. Determine the total capacity of the tank.
3. Calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.

First, let's find out how much gas Sophia used to travel 100 miles. Since she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles, we can calculate the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon:

\[ \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of the tank is 12 gallons. Now, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

answer:  To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Top level: 16 square units
- Second level: 16 / 2 = 8 square units
- Third level: 8 / 2 = 4 square units
- Fourth level: 4 / 2 = 2 square units

Now, we sum up the square footage of all four levels:

Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square units

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage = 30 square units / 4 levels = 7.5 square units

Therefore, the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle is 7.5 square units.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes: \( 8 \text{ classes} \)

Total classes in a week: \( 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \)

Next, calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students: \( 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \)

Finally, calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week:
- She charges $15.00 per student: \( 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \)

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- Therefore, the revenue from brownies is \( 43 \times 3 \).

\[ 43 \times 3 = 129 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Therefore, the revenue from cheesecakes is \( 23 \times 4 \).

\[ 23 \times 4 = 92 \]

Now, we sum the revenues from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:
- Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
- Total revenue = $129 + $92

\[ 129 + 92 = 221 \]

 Tommy raises a total of $221.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume for the rest of the year:

2 cups/day * 365 days - 180 days) = 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to cover 550 cups:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag ≈ 5.009 bags

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number:

   - Therefore, Marcia has \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Marcia has 6 pets.
   - Therefore, Jan has \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) pets.

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Cindy has 4 pets.
   - Marcia has 6 pets.
   - Jan has 18 pets.
   - The total number of pets is \( 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \).

So, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have is 28.

answer:  First, let's determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we add the water received by the boy to the total water received by the girls. The boy received 6 liters of water, so we have:

\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water received by the girls and the boy from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left. The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so we have:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 10 \text{ liters} \]

The answer is 10 liters.

answer:  To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
2. Determine the number of vacations he has been on in those years.
3. Calculate the total number of quilt blocks based on the number of vacations.

First, let's find the number of years Gene has been vacationing:
- Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
- He is now 34 years old.
- Number of years he has been vacationing = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Next, let's determine the number of vacations he has been on in those years:
- Gene goes on 4 vacations per year.
- Total number of vacations = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Finally, since each vacation is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations:
- Total number of quilt blocks = 44 vacations = 44 quilt blocks.

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The remaining students are girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the Girl Scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the Girl Scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout is:

answer:  To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each occurrence and then sum them up.

1. **First occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for three times as long as the first occurrence.
   - Since the first occurrence lasted 4 rings, the second occurrence lasted \(3 \times 4 = 12\) rings.

3. **Third occurrence:**
   - The alarm rang for half as long as the second occurrence.
   - Since the second occurrence lasted 12 rings, the third occurrence lasted \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) rings.

Now, we sum up the total number of rings:
- First occurrence: 4 rings
- Second occurrence: 12 rings
- Third occurrence: 6 rings

Total rings = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

answer:  Let's denote the number of games lost by the football team as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games won can be expressed as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

The total number of copies sold by both records is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Calculate the division:

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for adults = 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult dinosaur, which means each child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Total potato salad for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Now, let's add the total amount of potato salad needed for both the adult and child dinosaurs:
- Total potato salad needed = Total potato salad for adults + Total potato salad for children
- Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to have enough for all the adult and child dinosaurs.

answer:  To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover and then use the given rate of coverage.

The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite edge. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, we find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ \text{Number of 3-mile segments} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment. Therefore, the total time to cover 14 segments is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

1. Calculate how many hours James slept.
2. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

First, let's find out how many hours James slept. James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. Harry slept 9 hours, so:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, James slept 6 hours.

Next, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Hours Harry slept} - \text{Hours James slept} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( 30 - x \).

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the second 15 minutes is \( (30 - x) + 20 = 50 - x \).

Then, 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( (50 - x) - 5 = 45 - x \).

We know that after these events, there are still 30 cars on the motorway. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 45 - x = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 \]

So, the cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes are 5.

First, we know that when Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.

\[ \text{Original volume} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the original volume by the volume of each can:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4 \]

Finally, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Next, we subtract the pages he has already read from the total:

Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Total revenue = \(10 \times 15 + 5 \times 24 = 150 + 120 = $270\)

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

answer:  First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of each box after accounting for the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions will be:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 2 inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
- Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
- Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
- Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * 3
- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
- Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he intended to make \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

To verify, if he baked 50 cookies last year, he would have baked 100 cookies this year (twice as many), and after dropping 5, he would have 110 cookies.

answer:  To determine the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback amount.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback:
- The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
- The person buys 10 gallons.
- Total cost before cashback = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cashback amount:
- The app company offers $0.20 per gallon.
- The person buys 10 gallons.
- Total cashback = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00.

Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:
- Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00.

answer:  Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write:
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30000 \]

So, Lylah earned $30,000 four years ago.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Lylah's salary remains unchanged, so her new salary is still $30,000.

The total salary they are receiving four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 30000 = 86000 \]

The answer is $86,000.

answer:  To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

**Beatrice's roll-ups:**
- Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Total roll-ups = 2 roll-ups * 24 roll-ups = 48 roll-ups.

**Marcell's roll-ups:**
- Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Total roll-ups = 3 roll-ups * 14 roll-ups = 42 roll-ups.

**Total roll-ups eaten by both:**
- Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = 48 roll-ups + 42 roll-ups = 90 roll-ups.

**Average number of roll-ups eaten:**
- Average = Total roll-ups / Number of people
- Average = 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups.

So, the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45 roll-ups.

answer:  To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour and the remaining time at 5 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours:
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. Add the distances from both segments to find the total distance:
   - Distance in the first 3 hours: 30 miles
   - Distance in the remaining 4 hours: 20 miles
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

answer:  Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \).

According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, Jamal's phone can hold \( 6B \) photographs.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 6B = 1800 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

The problem also states that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 50D = 300 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

answer:  To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

Next, we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined is 120. Since the ratio is 7:13, the number of parts for sugar is 7, and the number of parts for water is 13.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of parts by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, we calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by the number of parts for sugar:
\[ \text{Number of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

First, let's calculate his expenditure in June:
\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = \text{Expenditure in May} - 60 \]
\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 - 60 \]
\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = 440 \]

Next, we add the expenditures for May and June to find the total expenditure:
\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \text{Expenditure in May} + \text{Expenditure in June} \]
\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = 500 + 440 \]
\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = 940 \]

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
2. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month.

First, let's find the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week:
- Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.
- There are 30 sheets of paper in each pad.

So, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses per month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks (which is a common approximation for a month), we can calculate the number of sheets he uses per month by multiplying the number of sheets per week by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

1. Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
4. After setting the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total revenue from patients is 500 * $80 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the doctors. Each doctor charges $150 per hour, so the cost per patient is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total cost for the doctors is 500 * $60 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

answer:  To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total distance Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total distance for Monday and Tuesday from the total distance for Monday through Wednesday to find the distance for Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday:
- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
- Therefore, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.

Next, let's determine the total distance Walt walked on Monday and Tuesday:
- Total distance for Monday and Tuesday = 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles.

Finally, we subtract the total distance for Monday and Tuesday from the total distance for Monday through Wednesday to find the distance for Wednesday:
- Total distance for Monday through Wednesday = 41 miles.
- Distance for Wednesday = 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles.

Therefore, Walt walked \boxed{13} miles on Wednesday.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Total tickets for roller coaster rides: \(12 + 24 = 36\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tickets used for the luge rides:

- Pam rode the luge 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Fred rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Total tickets for luge rides: \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Finally, let's add the tickets used for all rides:

- Total tickets used: \(36\) (roller coaster) + \(24\) (luge) = \(60\) tickets.

answer:  To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of car washes Tom gets in a year.
2. Multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash.

First, let's calculate the number of car washes Tom gets in a year:
- Tom gets 4 car washes per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of car washes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:
- Each car wash costs $15.

So, the total cost for a year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]

She orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, so the cost of the chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
She orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so the cost of the cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.
There is a 20% delivery fee, so the delivery fee is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.
She wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the total cost of the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.
Therefore, the total cost of her delivery order is $29.00.

answer:  To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
2. Calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns.

First, let's find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands:
- There are 27 unicorns in total.
- One third of these unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.

\[
\text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female:
- Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
\]

To calculate this, we can perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[

answer:  First, let's determine the number of bees that left and returned in each period:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half as many bees returned as left, so \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees returned.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees left as returned, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left and returned:

- Bees that left: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \)
- Bees that returned: \( 30 + 15 = 45 \)

Since every bee that left before and hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is equal to the number of bees that left but hadn't returned yet, which is 45.

Therefore, Debra saw 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

The answer is 45.

answer:  Let's denote the number of queen bees as \( Q \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).

There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know the total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solving for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, the number of queen bees is 100.

The number of baby bees is \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \).
The number of worker bees is \( 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

- He is talking to 5 more potential clients.
- Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, let's calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per client = 2 bottles * $2 per bottle = $4.
- Cost of cloths per client = 1 pack * $5 per pack = $5.
- Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9.
- Total cost for 8 clients = 8 clients * $9 per client = $72.

Now, let's calculate the total income each week:
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72

answer:  To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many friends Dorothy has.
2. Use the number of friends Dorothy has to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 12 \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the value of Dorothy's friends, we get:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

answer:  Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

answer:  Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. Therefore, Blake runs:
\[ 15 \times 100 = 1500 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly does this 34 times, so she runs:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the 100 yards she runs back and forth once, Kelly's total distance is:
\[ 100 + 2720 = 2820 \text{ yards} \]

The difference in distance run by Kelly and Blake is:
\[ 2820 - 1500 = 1320 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Kelly) runs 1320 yards farther than Blake.

answer:  To determine how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of each item he bought and then sum them up.

1. **Pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

2. **Notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

3. **Rim of Bond Paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The rim of bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for rim of bond paper = 1 rim * $20/rim = $20.

answer:  To determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the depth of the water on Monday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the depth on Monday.
3. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday by taking two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

answer:  To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and then apply this increase over the 36 months.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Every Two Months**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
   - 20% of $20 is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the price after each two-month increase is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Number of Two-Month Periods in 36 Months**: Since the price increases every two months, there are \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) two-month periods in 36 months.

4. **Total Cost After 36 Months**:
   - The price after 18 periods is \( 24 \times 18 = 432 \) dollars.

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost $432 dollars after 36 months.

answer:  First, calculate the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50 \text{ per glass} = \$10 \]

Next, determine the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} \]
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Since they made a profit of $25, the total revenue must be:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Profit} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$25 + \$25 = \$50 \]

Now, calculate the total cost of lemons:
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = \text{Total cost per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = \$5 \times 10 = \$50 \]

Therefore, they spent $50 on lemons.

answer:  To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.
2. Subtract the total cost from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the computer and accessories:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Next, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Budget: €1500
- Total cost: €1423

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1423

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

answer:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the potential income loss from doing the taxes herself to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the potential income loss from doing the taxes herself:
- If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will miss 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour.
- Therefore, the total income loss is:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours} \times \$35 \text{ per hour} = \$105
  \]

Next, let's consider the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, let's determine the net amount of money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant:
- The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.
- The potential income loss from doing the taxes herself is $105.
- Therefore, the net amount of money she will have is:
  \[
  \$90 - \$105 = -\$15

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays = 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekends in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends = 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week:

- Total miles walked in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekends) = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   - The hat costs $25.

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jacket is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   - The average cost of the hat and the jacket is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
   - Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
   - Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

**Team A:**
- Each runner runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 runners.
- Total time for Team A = 4 runners * 55 seconds per runner = 220 seconds.

**Team B:**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs their leg in 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs their leg in 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs their leg in 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds.
- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

- Student loans: $300 + (50% of $300) = $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 + (50% of $200) = $200 + $100 = $200
- Mortgage: $500 + (50% of $500) = $500 + $250 = $750

Next, sum the increased monthly payments for all debts to find the total monthly payment:

- Total monthly payment = $450 + $200 + $750 = $1400

Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the total annual payment:

2. Subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

First, let's calculate the number of votes the winner received:

The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. The total number of students who voted is 80.

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Next, we subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner}
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 20
\]

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

answer:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 5W = 200 \).
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

2. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, \( R = 4W \).
   - Substituting \( W = 40 \):
     \[
     R = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business with him.

answer:  To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement.

First, let's find the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks:
- Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
- There are 10 ducks.

So, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/du/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement:
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the daily requirement is:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs approximately 5.14 pounds of insects per day.

1. **Jan's current age:**
   - Jan is currently 30 years old.

2. **Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Half of Jan's age is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years old.

3. **Mark's current age:**
   - Since two years ago, Mark was 20 years old, his current age is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) years old.

4. **Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) years old.

So, Jean is currently 24 years old.

answer:  To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.

The cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \text{Cost of one pen} \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$1.50 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of8 pens is $12.00.

Next, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes:
\[ \frac{3}{6} \times \frac{3}{6} = \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, find the difference in probability:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

1. Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
2. Calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna.
3. Add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total.

First, we know that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.

Next, we know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples picked by Jenna as follows:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples picked by Jenna} + \text{Number of apples picked by her mom} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jenna and her mother picked 30 apples.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters and rabbits.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw:
\[ 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats. We know the total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160. Subtract the pieces distributed to the hamsters and rabbits from the total:
\[ 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \]

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of rats is:
\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we need to find out how many rats are in each cage. Divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from each publisher:

- Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.

Now, calculate the total earnings from each publisher:

- Earnings from Publisher A: \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents
- Earnings from Publisher B: \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents

Finally, add the earnings from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

\[ \boxed 7500 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183.00 \]

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total amount spent by the number of friends:

answer:  Let's denote the number of bags of wheat sold as \( x \).

The trader buys each bag for $20 and spends $2 to transport each bag, so the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ 30x \text{ dollars} \]

The profit made by the trader is the difference between the revenue and the total cost. Therefore, the profit is:
\[ 30x - 22x = 8x \text{ dollars} \]

We know that the trader made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find the number of bags sold, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The answer is:

answer:  Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, so he ate 7 sandwiches in a week. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.

\[ 7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 2 \text{ slices per sandwich} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Carl also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in a week. Each omelet uses one more slice than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 3 slices of cheese.

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices per omelet} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Additionally, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we add up all the slices:

\[ 14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese this week.

On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the pinkos and painted them white. One third of 18 is 6, so they took back 6 pink flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out. This means there are now 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 18 + 18 = 36.

Now, there are 36 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

36 pink flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 30

Therefore, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month:

So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months:

\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

To find the total number of cards she has now, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each month:

answer:  Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens. According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \), and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

The total number of eggs collected every day is given as 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

answer:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori's part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance Michael rode in the first four weeks:

1. He rode the bike 5 times a week.
2. Each ride was 25 kilometers.
3. In one week, he rode 5 rides * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week.
4. For four weeks, he rode 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km.

Next, let's calculate the total distance Michael rode in the next three weeks:

1. He rode the bike 2 times a week.
2. Each ride was 60 kilometers.
3. In one week, he rode 2 rides * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week.
4. For three weeks, he rode 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km.

Finally, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total distance Michael rode:

Total distance = 500 km (first four weeks) + 360 km (next three weeks) = 860 km.

The answer is 860 kilometers.

answer:  To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
4 + 12 = 16
\]
\[

answer:  To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the total score she needs for all six tests.

The average is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of tests. Therefore, for an average of 93 over six tests, the total score needed is:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Next, we sum up the scores Brinley has from the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The total score for all six tests will be:
\[ 438 + x = 558 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 558 - 438 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

answer:  To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Therefore, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo is:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

answer:  Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to earn:
\[ 4x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000.

\[ \text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ \text{Total cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

A dozen is 12, so twenty dozen cups is:

\[ \text{Number of cups} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:

\[ \text{Cost of each cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

answer:  To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide that by his walking speed.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 1.5 miles
- Width = 6 miles

So, the perimeter is:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( T \) he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]
\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

1. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the first year.
2. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.
3. Add the amounts spent in both years to get the total.

1. The company spends $15000 on advertising in the first year.
2. The company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year on advertising in the second year. Therefore, the amount spent in the second year is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
   \]
3. To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:
   \[
   15000 + 5000 = 20000

answer:  Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

Since the pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, over 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

So, the amount of water left in the small pool now is \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water left in the big pool now is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 4x - 2x = 64 - 16 \]
\[ 2x = 48 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + (0.10 \times 2000) \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month.

\[ \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Total payment} = 1980 \]

Now, let's find the remaining balance after 12 months.

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total payment} \]

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $220.

1. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
2. Determine the total number of customers from the first two days.
3. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, let's calculate the number of customers on the second day:
- On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day.
- Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.

Next, let's find the total number of customers from the first two days:
- Total customers from the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250

2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Adding these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

So, the total cost of the meal is $14.00.

Next, Chad uses a gift card worth $5.00. Therefore, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total cost of the meal:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Thus, Chad still owes $9.00 after using the gift card.

2. Adrian's current age: 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years
3. Zack's current age: 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
2. Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years
3. Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years

Now, we find the average age in three years:

Average age = (Harriet's age in three years + Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (24 + 66 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45 years

answer:  To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus:**
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, it takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days to travel by car.

Now, let's add up the total travel time for both legs of the trip:

- Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus: 6 days
- Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car: 3 days

Total travel time for one-way trip:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ days} \]

Since the trip is round trip, we need to double the one-way travel time:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of \( 18 \) days.

answer:  First, calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:
12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000

Next, calculate the tax on the total cost:
10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Then, add the tax to the total cost to find the cost including tax:
$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Now, calculate the total registration cost for all cars:
12 cars * $1,000/car = $12,000

Finally, add the registration cost to the cost including tax to find the total amount Mark pays:
$264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, Mark pays $276,000 for the fleet of 12 cars, including the cost of the cars, tax, and registration.

answer:  To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of ants and the number of bugs.

Given:
- There are 50 ants.
- There are half as many bugs as ants.

First, calculate the number of bugs:
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} \]
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \]
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = 25 \]

Next, add the number of ants and the number of bugs to find the total number of insects:
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 \]
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were harvested after two months.

Next, determine the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after the first harvest.

Now, calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest two weeks later:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were harvested two weeks later.

Finally, determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

answer:  To determine the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider both the pens he initially buys and the new pens he can create by mixing the ink from his empty pens.

1. **Initial Pens:**
   - Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Creating New Pens:**
   - Ram can create one new pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens.
   - Therefore, for every five empty pens, he can create one new pen.

3. **Calculating New Pens:**
   - If Ram buys 25 pens, he can create 25 new pens by mixing the ink from his empty pens.
   - This is because each new pen is made from five empty pens, and he has 25 pens initially.

4. **Total Pens:**
   - Ram initially has 25 pens.
   - He can create 25 new pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of pens he gets to have is:
     \[

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas divides these 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:

Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, James has:

answer:  To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed each night and then sum them up.

**Last night:**
- Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Rick killed 15 cougars.

Total animals killed last night:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

**Today:**
- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Rick killed three fewer cougars than last night.

First, calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ wolves} \]

Next, calculate the number of cougars killed today:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

Total animals killed today:
\[ 45 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 57 \text{ animals} \]

**Total animals killed over the two nights:**
\[ 25 + 57 = 82 \]

answer:  To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Determine how many times Robert went down the water slide based on Anne's performance.

First, let's calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, and Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - (0.30 \times 30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's times} = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times \text{Anne's times} \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Robert's times} = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide \(84\) times.

answer:  To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for each house is:
  \[
  3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows per house}
  \]

Next, let's add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in each house is:
  \[
  6 \text{ windows} + 4 \text{ windows} = 10 \text{ windows per house}
  \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is:
\[
10 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, there are 20 windows in total between the two houses.

answer:  To find out how much Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Pennies:
   - 100 pennies * $0.01 per penny = $1.00

2. Nickels:
   - 40 nickels * $0.05 per nickel = $2.00

3. Dimes:
   - 20 dimes * $0.10 per dime = $2.00

4. Dollar bills:
   - 40 dollar bills * $1.00 per dollar bill = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:

$1.00 (penies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 dollars in his piggy bank.

answer:  First, we need to determine the total weight of the 200-foot redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the 200-foot tree is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \times 400 \text{ pounds/foot} = 80000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight the termites ate. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.

30% of 80000 pounds is:
\[ 0.30 \times 80000 \text{ pounds} = 24000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:
\[ 80000 \text{ pounds} - 24000 \text{ pounds} = 56000 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the tree is 56000 pounds.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part:

1. **Solo Song:**
   - Sean's solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines.

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2 \times 36}{12} = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, let's determine how many cups of flour are needed for 30 cookies. Using the same proportion:

answer:  To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup.
2. Convert the number of pennies into dollars.

First, let's find two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.

Next, we need to convert 6,200 pennies into dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is $62.

So, the total dollar amount in the stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

Next, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
Brokerage fee = $20,000

Now, calculate the total amount paid:
Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
Total amount paid = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
Total amount paid = $282,000

Finally, calculate the net proceeds:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
Net proceeds = $118,000

answer:  Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \), and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[ 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, calculate the total price of the house:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Finally, determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
Difference = Total price - Budget

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5/ad * 50 ads = $<<5*50=250>>250

- He bought 15 television ads.
- Total cost for television ads = $75/ad * 15 ads = $<<75*15=1125>>1125

Now, we add the total cost of the newspaper ads and the total cost of the television ads:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $13,375 on buying all the ads.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so it takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Next, we calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the sleeves is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:

2. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
Amount paid = $20.00
Total cost = $15.00

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $15.00
Change = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

There are 8 children, so we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

answer:  To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

1. **Time for small holes:**
   - It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - For 30 small holes: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes.

2. **Time for large holes:**
   - It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
   - For 15 large holes: \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes.

3. **Total time in minutes:**
   - Total time = \( 90 + 150 = 240 \) minutes.

4. **Convert total time to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \( \frac{240}{60} = 4 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

answer:  First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after accounting for the cards with the letter A:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after accounting for the cards with the letter B:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C:
\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D by subtracting the number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards:
\[ 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards with the letter D is:

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of people at the soccer game:

1. There are 12 team members.
2. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \).
3. There are 3 coaches.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195.

answer:  On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total for the first day:
100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total for the second day:
120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises

Total for both days:
170 exercises (first day) + 200 exercises (second day) = 370 exercises

Therefore, Darren has done a total of 370 exercises in the two days.

answer:  To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
\[ \text{Cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
\[ \text{Cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of popsicles} + \text{Cost of ice cream bars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the total number of spots for all the snakes combined:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half of total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

answer:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and covered 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 30 miles/hour. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we use the same formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

answer:  To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that together they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find the number of medals Izzy has:
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
- Total medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals = 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We know that together they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is:
- Total medals given out = 39 * 10 = 390.

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

answer:  To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

First, we know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books she sold in the second year. Since the problem does not provide the number of books sold in the second year, we will assume she sold 45 books in the second year as well.

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

- Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after distributing the extra points:

- Mike's total points: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim's total points: 18 points.
- Tony's total points: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds by dividing the total weight loss by her weekly weight loss:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves} \]

Therefore, 5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

answer:  To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the structure of the tabloid. Each page in the tabloid is printed on both sides of a piece of paper, with one side being the left side and the other being the right side.

For a 32-page tabloid:
- Page 1 is printed on the left back.
- Page 2 is printed on the left front.
- Page 32 is printed on the right back.
- Page 31 is printed on the right front.

Since each page is printed on both sides of a piece of paper, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of paper required.

Each page requires 2 pieces of paper (one for the left side and one for the right side). Therefore, for a 32-page tabloid:
\[ 32 \text{ pages} \times 2 \text{ pieces of paper per page} = 64 \text{ pieces of paper} \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is:
\[

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) people
- She invited 3 families with 4 people each: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) people

Total invited people: \( 12 + 12 = 24 \) people

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness: \( 8 \) people
- 1/4 of the number of people due to illness had previous commitments: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people

Total people who couldn't come: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of invited people to find out how many people showed up:

Total people who showed up: \( 24 - 10 = 14 \) people

Therefore, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is 14.

answer:  First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:

1. Watson works 10 hours per day.
2. He works 5 days a week.
3. He earns $10 per hour.

Weekly earnings = hourly wage * hours worked per day * days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day * 5 days/week
Weekly earnings = $500/week

Next, let's add the $300 bonus he receives each week:

Weekly earnings with bonus = weekly earnings + bonus
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week
Weekly earnings with bonus = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April:

1. April has 4 weeks.
2. Weekly earnings with bonus = $800/week.

Monthly earnings with bonus = weekly earnings with bonus * number of weeks in April
Monthly earnings with bonus = $800/week * 4 weeks
Monthly earnings with bonus = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed well for the whole month.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1250

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$6000 + $150 + $1250 = $7400

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has:

answer:  Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) represent the number of electric poles and \( W \) represent the number of electric wires. According to the ratio:

\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We are given that the total number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. Therefore, we can substitute \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by cross-multiplying:

\[
P \times 3 = 45
\]

\[
P = \frac{45}{3}
\]

\[
P = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

answer:  Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Given that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{6D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 6D = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ D = \frac{210}{6} = 35 \]

Therefore, there are 35 players on the defense.

answer:  To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the addition of cream.

1. **Cooling effect of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - Number of ice cubes used = 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes.

2. **Weakness due to ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Total weakness due to ice cubes = 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters.

3. **Weakness due to cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - Additional weakness due to cream = 15 milliliters.

4. **Total weakness:**
   - Total weakness = 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is **75 milliliters** weaker.

Therefore, Noah's current age is:

\[ 23 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. So, the population of Chile six years ago was:

\[ 3000 \times 29 = 87000 \]

Since six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is:

answer:  To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool:
- The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet.
- The depth of the pool is 5 feet.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]
\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10.

The total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.10 \]
\[ C = 12 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

So, we have:

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, each box contains 8 pencils.

Jam has 24 pencils in boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is:
\[ 24 + 46 = 70 \]

To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{70}{8} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 9 \]

Thus, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:

So, 10 people left the party.

Next, we need to determine how many people stayed:

People who stayed = 40 - 10 = 30 people

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of women who stayed is:

Women who stayed = People who stayed - Men who stayed = 30 - 22 = 8 women

Now, we need to find out how many women are left. Since 10 people left and 5 of them were men (because 25 men - 20 men = 5 men left), the number of women who left is:

Women who left = People who left - Men who left = 10 - 5 = 5 women

answer:  Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \). According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is given as 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:
- Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \) legs.
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) legs.

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 \text{ (cows)} + 80 \text{ (chickens)} = 160 \]

Therefore, the animals have a total of 160 legs altogether.

answer:  To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned.
2. Apply the rewards to the total purchase.
3. Apply the coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned.**

The customer spent $43 this shopping trip. The loyalty card gives $1 off for every $20 spent.

\[ \text{ Rewards} = \left\lfloor \frac{43}{20} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the total purchase.**

Subtract the rewards from the total purchase:

\[ \text{ Purchase after rewards} = 43 - 2 = 41 \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off:

\[ \text{ Coupon discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

\[ \text{ Final amount paid} = 41 - 4 = 37 \]

\boxed{37}

answer:  Let's denote the number of old records each person brought in as \( x \).

According to the exchange rate, 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. Therefore, each person will receive \( \frac{x}{2} \) new records.

Since there are 5 people, the total number of new records they receive is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} \]

We know that they leave with 7 new records between them. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 7 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 5x = 14 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \]

So, each person brought in 2.8 old records. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records they brought in is:
\[ 5 \times 2.8 = 14 \]

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

1. Advance payment: $1,350
2. Monthly installments: 6 installments * $350 per installment = $2,100

Total cost for Furniture United's offer = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:

1. Advance payment: $1,100
2. Monthly installments: 9 installments * $250 per installment = $2,250

Total cost for Cozy Homes' offer = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:

Total cost for Furniture United's offer: $3,450
Total cost for Cozy Homes' offer: $3,350

Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

1. Calculate the new distance Tyson needs to run each day.
2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June.

First, let's find the new distance Tyson needs to run each day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more than his current distance.

\[ \text{New distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} \]
\[ \text{New distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} \]
\[ \text{New distance} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June. June has 30 days.

\[ \text{Total distance} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, calculate how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} - \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

1. **Calculate the total percentage increase needed:**
   - Current charge: 60%
   - Final charge: 100%
   - Total increase: 100% - 60% = 40%

2. **Determine the time required to increase 40%:**
   - The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes.
   - Therefore, to increase 40 percentage-points, it will take:
     \[
     40 \text{ percentage-points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage-point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

answer:  Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

The number of students in the smallest group is:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

Total weight = Weight of pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird + Container weight
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 260 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal and the container is 260 pounds.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs:
- There are 40 tables with 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for these tables is \( 40 \times 4 = 160 \) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
- There are 50 tables with 3 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs for these tables is \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to get the total number of legs:
- Total legs = 160 (from tables with 4 legs) + 150 (from tables with 3 legs)
- Total legs = 310

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

answer:  First, calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house:
- Distance to friend's house: 200 miles
- Speed: 70 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 30 hours

Next, add the detour to the original distance:
- Detour distance: 10 miles
- Total distance with detour: 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Now, calculate the time it took for John to drive home from his friend's house:
- Distance home: 240 miles
- Speed: 80 mph
- Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Finally, add the times for both legs of the trip to find the total time:
- Time to friend's house: 30 hours
- Time home: 3 hours
- Total time: 30 hours + 3 hours = 33 hours

Therefore, the total time for John's trip, including the detour, is 33 hours.

answer:  First, calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors} \times \$100 \text{ per tractor} = \$1000 \]

Next, calculate the daily revenue from silos:
\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos} \times \$220 \text{ per silo} = \$1100 \]

Now, determine the increase in daily revenue:
\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

Finally, calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Daily revenue from tractors}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants to include:

1. Mini-golf: $5 per round
2. Arcade tokens: $5
3. Go-karts: $10 per ride * 2 rides = $20

Adding these costs together:
\[ $5 + $5 + $20 = $30 \]

Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. After accounting for the activities, she has:
\[ $90 - $30 = $60 remaining \]

Next, let's determine how much money each person will spend:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $10

Total cost per person:
\[ $5 + $5 + $10 = $20 \]

Now, let's find out how many friends Morgan can invite with the remaining $60:
\[ $60 \div $20 = 3 \]

Since Morgan herself is also part of the party, she can invite:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \]

Therefore, 3 friends.

1. Customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks: 3
2. Customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4 times the number for refusing to wear masks minus 5
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
3. Customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale: 3 times the number of shoplifters
   \[

Since Andrea had $36 in the beginning, the amount of money she had left after spending $15 is:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

This $21 is the amount of money she had left after spending the rest of her money. Therefore, the amount of money she saved is:

answer:  First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one round trip:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city to the first city: 100 + 75 - 50 = 125 miles

Now, let's find the total distance for one round trip:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The train makes this round trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 3 \times 300 = 900 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance it needs service by the distance it travels in one day:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. The average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds is \( \frac{8 + 2}{2} = 5 \) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:
- For 4 chihuahua beds: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) pounds.
- For 3 collie beds: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) pounds.

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

answer:  To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then sum them up.

1. **Friday:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday:**
   - The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Saturday = 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

3. **Sunday:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Number of pairs sold on Sunday = 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
   - However, six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, we sum up the number of pairs sold each day:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, and this is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find the age of Carver's son, we need to solve this equation for \( x \).

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
   \[ 50 = 2x \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

Given:
- There are 6 girls in the park.
- There are twice the number of boys in the park.

Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of girls is twice the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ 6 = 2B \]

To find the number of boys, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ B = 3 \]

So, there are 3 boys in the park.

Now, we add the number of girls and the number of boys to find the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, there are **9 kids** in the park.

answer:  Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue from selling all the cups is 36 * $1 = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $36 - $18
Profit = $18

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find her profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she runs her lemonade stand. Since we don't have the exact number of hours, we can express the profit per hour in terms of the number of hours:

Profit per Hour = Total Profit / Number of Hours
Profit per Hour = $18 / Number of Hours

Without the exact number of hours, we can't calculate the exact profit per hour. However, if we assume she runs her lemonade stand for a certain number of hours, we can calculate the profit per hour based on that number of hours.

answer:  To determine the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours for each day.

1. On Tuesdays, she had dance practice for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.

First, let's calculate the hours for each day:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: Twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours for each day:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

Total hours per day = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total hours per day by 7:

Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days = 35 hours

Therefore, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 35 hours a week.

answer:  To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Cho = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Cloe = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in distance between Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance_Cho - Distance_Cloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

answer:  To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, let's calculate the total number of socks from the pairs:
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
- Each pair consists of 2 socks.
- Therefore, the total number of socks from the pairs is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) socks.

Next, let's add the loose socks:
- Lindsay has 15 loose socks.

Now, let's add the socks from the pairs and the loose socks:
- Total socks from pairs: 20
- Total loose socks: 15
- Total socks washed: \( 20 + 15 = 35 \) socks

Finally, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that need washing:
- Total socks needing washing: 50
- Total socks washed: 35
- Socks missed: \( 50 - 35 = 15 \) socks

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

answer:  Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combine like terms:

\[11x = 165\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\)
- Sam's popsicles: \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\).

answer:  First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the members are boys and 50% are girls:

- Number of boys = 52 * 0.50 = 26 boys
- Number of girls = 52 * 0.50 = 26 girls

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of girls performing is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls performing can't make it to the show:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13 girls

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Total number of people singing = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers
- Total number of people singing = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people

#### 16 people sang in the performance.

answer:  To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total interest over five months.
2. Add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid.
3. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total interest over five months. The interest rate is 10%, so the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 = 365 \]

Next, we add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid:

\[ \text{Total Amount to be Paid} = 3650 + 365 = 4015 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{4015}{5} = 803 \]

So, Karan has to pay $803 per month.

answer:  To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth first.

1. We know that Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica. Therefore, Beth's age is:
   \[
   \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth. Therefore, Alice's age is:
   \[
   \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, we can find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:
\[
\text{Difference in ages} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \text{ years}

First, let's add up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of tests to find the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

To determine if he can have the car for the weekend, we need to check if his math grade is 80 or higher. Since his grade is exactly 80, he meets the requirement.

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80, and he is eligible for the car for the weekend.

answer:  Let \( x \) be the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

After selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. According to the problem, this remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had <<32=32=32>> 32 hectares of land.

\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watts/day} \]

If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watts/day} \]

The difference in energy usage per day is:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts/day} - 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 4500 \text{ watts/day} \]

To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4500 \text{ watts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watts} \]

So, Mel will save 13.5 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

answer:  To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica has to wrap.
2. Determine the total length of ribbon she has.
3. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- She has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Next, we know she has 144 inches of ribbon.

Now, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find the amount of ribbon per gift:
Ribbon per gift = Total length of ribbon / Total number of gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The answer is 12 inches per gift.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Millipedes:**
   - Nancy saw \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many millipedes as spiders.
   - Number of millipedes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).

3. **Stink Bugs:**
   - The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   - Number of stink bugs = \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, we add up all the bugs:
- Number of spiders = 90

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:

- The first package is worth $400.
- The second package is worth twice as much as the first, so it is worth 2 * $400 = $800.

Total cost before discount = $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework to the total cost after the discount:

Total amount spent = $960 + $150 = $1110.

1. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:**
   - The builder works 4 weeks every month.
   - The builder works 6 days every week.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a month is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) days.

2. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of days worked in a year is \( 24 \times 12 = 288 \) days.

3. **Calculate the builder's daily earnings:**
   - The builder gets paid $50 every day.

4. **Calculate the builder's annual earnings:**
   - Multiply the number of days worked in a year by the daily earnings.
   - Therefore, the annual earnings are \( 288 \times 50 = 14,400 \) dollars.

So, the builder earns $14,400 in a year.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services without the discount:

- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 per month each, so $10 + $10 = $20 per month

Without the discount, the total cost would be:
- $10 + $20 = $30 per month

Next, let's calculate the discount Tim gets for bundling:
- He saves 20% on the total cost.
- 20% of $30 is 0.20 * $30 = $6.

So, the total cost of the streaming services with the discount is:
- $30 - $6 = $24 per month

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package:
- The cable package cost $60 per month.
- The streaming services with the discount cost $24 per month.

The difference in cost is:
- $60 - $24 = $36 per month

Therefore, Tim saves $36 per month by cancelling his $60 cable package.

- Quadruple batch: 6 cups of flour
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so Mark needs 6 cups / 2 cups per bag = 3 bags of flour.

For the milk:
- Normal batch: 1 cup of milk
- Quadruple batch: 2 cups of milk
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs 2 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 1 bottle of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- Number of bags of flour: 3
- Number of bottles of milk: 1

Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk
Difference = 3 - 1 = 2

Therefore, Mark has to buy 2 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

answer:  Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so each sandwich requires 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of cheese.
To serve 20 people, Tyson will need 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.
Therefore, he will need 5 sandwiches * 2 pounds of meat per sandwich = 10 pounds of meat.
He will also need 5 sandwiches * 2 pounds of cheese per sandwich = 10 pounds of cheese.
The cost of the meat will be 10 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $70.00.
The cost of the cheese will be 10 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $30.00.
The total cost of the meat and cheese will be $70.00 + $30.00 = $100.00.

answer:  Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \( x \).

Joanne gathers:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees
- 15 apples from the shortest trees (half of 30)
- \( x \) apples from the average trees

Her sister gathers:
- 2 * 30 = 120 apples from the tallest trees
- 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees
- 0 apples from the average trees

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (120 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 90 + x + 160 = 500 \]
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, Joanne gathered \boxed{250} apples from the average trees.

answer:  First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices given away:
\[ 4 \text{ slices (Bill)} + 3 \text{ slices (Mark)} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's subtract the slices given away from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 7 \text{ slices} = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract those from the remaining slices:
\[ 5 \text{ slices} - 2 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \text{ slices} \]

answer:  First, let's determine the number of corns Allan initially has. Since he has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Now, let's find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} \]
\[ \text{Combined total} = 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Determine the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver.

First, let's find the elevation of Stanley's comb:
- Stanley's initial elevation is 10,000 feet.
- The comb fell 4,000 feet below Stanley's elevation.

So, the elevation of Stanley's comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know Oliver's elevation is 3,000 feet.

Now, we calculate the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb **3,000 feet** to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

answer:  In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

Total payment in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $36,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees lost their contracts.

The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

The company continues to pay these 30 employees $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

Total payment in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $36,000

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the payments for May and June:

Total payment = $36,000 + $36,000 = $72,000

Therefore, the company paid $72,000 in total in the two months.

answer:  To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stripes across all zebras.
2. Divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes:

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as 36: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

Adding these together:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- There are 4 zebras.

Now, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
\[ \frac{88}{4} = 22 \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, so the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so the savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in their original costs is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

1. Calculate the number of candles that are likely to explode.
2. Determine how many of those candles have a defect that make them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find the number of candles that are likely to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are likely to explode.

\[ \text{Number of candles that are likely to explode} = 50000 \times 0.01 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect, we calculate 5% of the 500 candles.

\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode} = 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

First, let's calculate the discount on each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

\[ \text{Discount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, we find the discounted price of each blouse by subtracting the discount from the regular price.

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses to find the total cost. Misha picked out 4 blouses.

- The book has 45 pages.
- Each page averages 200 words.
- Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 90000 words.

Next, let's calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book:
- Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
- Time to read the book = 90000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
- It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
- Total time to be at the airport = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time to be at the airport from the required time:
- Early time = 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

answer:  Kenny needs to buy a ticket for $100 and has $50 left for spending, so he needs to make $100 + $50 = $150 in total.

He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as \( x \).

The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x \).

We know that this amount is $150, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 150 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = 150 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 450 \]

So, Kenny started with 450 cards.

2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.

Let's denote the size of Zack's locker as \( Z \).
\[ Z = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ Z = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker.

Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \).
\[ T = 2 \times Z \]
\[ T = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ T = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

answer:  To determine the total cost Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price.
   - 25% of $4 is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) dollars.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half of the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) dollars

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11

So, Aleksandra needs to pay **$11** for the dinner she ordered.

answer:  To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second company.
2. Add the amounts received from both banks to find the total amount received.
3. Add the total amount received to his initial capital to find the new total.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second company. The second company gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second company gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks to find the total amount received:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Finally, we add the total amount received to his initial capital to find the new total:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000.

answer:  To determine the total number of letters in Indras' and her sister's names, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of letters in Indras' name.
2. Calculate the number of letters in Indras' sister's name.
3. Add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name.

Step 1: Indras' name has 6 letters.

Step 2: To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to calculate half of the letters in Indras' name and then add 4 to that number.
- Half of 6 letters is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).
- Adding 4 to 3 gives \( 3 + 4 = 7 \).

So, Indras' sister's name has 7 letters.

Step 3: Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name.
- Total letters = 6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13.

Therefore, the total number of letters is: 13.

1. **Wayne's Travel Time:**
   - It takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

2. **Bernadette's Travel Time:**
   - The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Bernadette's Desired Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Therefore, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne.

4. **Calculating the Time Difference:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes.
   - The difference in travel times is \( 16 - 4 = 12 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. **Buses:**
   - 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   - Total capacity for buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.

2. **Minibusses:**
   - 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   - Total capacity for minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.

3. **Minivans:**
   - 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   - Total capacity for minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

1. Set of pot and pans: $120.00
2. Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
3. 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars

Adding these together:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 165 \times 0.20 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount amount from the total cost:
\[ \text{Final cost} = 165 - 33 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Josey used. Since Josey used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total time Jon took for the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have taken 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: 10% faster than Jon, so 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes
- Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon, so 80 + 5 = 85 minutes
- Run: Let's denote the time James took for the run as R minutes.

Total time for James = 36 + 85 + R = 160 minutes

Solving for R:
121 + R = 160
R = 160 - 121
R = 39

James took 39 minutes for the run.

answer:  The food caterer initially prepared hot dogs for 36 guests. Half of the guests would have two hot dogs each, so:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests} \]

Each of these 18 guests would have two hot dogs, so:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs} \]

The caterer initially prepared 36 hot dogs, so the number of hot dogs left is:

\[ 80 - 36 = 44 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since each guest gets only one hot dog, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests} \]

So, these 4 guests did not get a second hot dog.

\[ \boxed{4} \]

Sitti bought 34 oranges.
Juris bought 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Next, we need to determine how many people will share the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 friends, so there are a total of 2 + 6 = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get.

Oranges per person = 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He had 1% of his money left, which is equivalent to 1% of 500 cents:
\[ 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

So, George had 5 cents left after buying the chips.

Now, let's calculate how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent a total of 500 cents and spent 120 cents on chips:
\[ 500 - 120 = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost per candy bar:
\[ 375 \div 75 = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:

Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2.00 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to transport all the feed.

Next, we need to figure out how many glasses of eggnog she can make with these eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs.

To find out how many glasses she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per glass:
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

So, Rozanne can make 10 glasses of eggnog.

Finally, we need to determine how many trays she can put out. Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.

To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

Rozanne can put out 2 trays of glasses.

answer:  First, calculate the number of sapphires Jenna has after trading 3 of them for rubies:
- Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.
- She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
- Therefore, she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires left.

Next, calculate the value of the remaining sapphires:
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- Jenna has 5 sapphires.
- The total value of the sapphires is \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.

Now, calculate the value of the rubies:
- Each ruby is worth $1200.
- Jenna has 2 rubies.
- The total value of the rubies is \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Finally, add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
- The total value of all jewels is \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars.

answer:  To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the pizza.
2. Determine the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the pizza cost.
3. Add the tip to the pizza cost to get the total amount.

1. The cost of the pizza is $15.
2. The tip amount is 1/5 of $15:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3
   \]
3. The total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is the sum of the pizza cost and the tip:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 15 + 3 = 18
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18.

answer:  To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and subtract the initial cost of the case.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each.
- Revenue from flash sale = 17 sneakers * $20/sneaker = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the remaining sneakers:
- The salesman sold the remaining 31 sneakers at $25 each.
- Revenue from remaining sneakers = 31 sneakers * $25/sneaker = $775

Now, let's find the total revenue from all the sales:
- Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from remaining sneakers
- Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost of the case from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost
- Profit = $1115 - $576 = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539.

answer:  Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

When you buy the super ticket, you pay $20 for the movie ticket and $1 for the popcorn and soda. Therefore, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

When you buy the movie ticket at the regular price, you pay $12 for the movie ticket, \( P \) for the popcorn, and $3 for the soda. Therefore, the total cost for the regular price is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the difference between the cost of the super ticket and the cost of the regular price is $2:
\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - 2 = P \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

2. Determine the number of fairies that joined from the east.
3. Add the number of fairies that joined from the east to the initial number of fairies.
4. Subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies.

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.
2. One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.
3. Add the number of fairies that joined from the east to the initial number of fairies: \( 50 + 25 = 75 \) fairies.
4. Subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies: \( 75 - 30 = 45 \) fairies.

answer:  To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance traveled during each segment of the trip:
- Distance at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

- Distance at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Now, calculate the total time taken for the trip:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, divide the total distance by the total time to find the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

2. Determine the number of plants Shondra has based on the information given.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants.

\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = \text{Number of plants Frederick has} + 60\% \text{ of Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.

\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = \text{Number of plants Toni has} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 = 9 \]

1. **Red Cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards:**
   - There are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).

4. **Total Number of Cards:**

1. **Cost of the plane tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

2. **Cost of the hotel stay:**
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.
   - The normal price is $1500 per day.
   - The increased price is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800 per day.
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost is $1800 * 3 days = $5400.

3. **Total cost of the trip:**
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.
   - Total cost = $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

answer:  First, we need to convert the length of the remoras to the same unit as the shark's body length. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the shark's body length from feet to inches:

10 feet = 10 * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Next, we calculate the combined length of the remoras:

2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. We use the formula:

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) * 100

Substituting the values:

Percentage = (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100

Simplify the fraction:

Percentage = (1/10) * 100

Calculate the percentage:

Percentage = 0.10 * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

answer:  To determine how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to account for the shoes he loses and gains throughout the week.

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes gained on Monday**: He gains 5 pairs of shoes.
   \[
   200 + 5 = 205
   \]

3. **Shoes gained on Wednesday**: He gains 15 new pairs of shoes.
   \[
   205 + 15 = 220
   \]

4. **Shoes gained on Friday**: He gains 30 more pairs of shoes.
   \[
   220 + 30 = 250
   \]

5. **Shoes lost on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes.
   \[
   250 - 180 = 70
   \]

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 70 shoes on Sunday.

\[
\text{Number of shoes Frank has on Sunday} = 70

answer:  To determine how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
- \( D \cap P \) as the set of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Given:
- \( |D| = 9 \)
- \( |P| = 6 \)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

The number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students with a desktop computer is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).

We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means that the number of students without a desktop computer is 20.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students with a desktop computer and students without a desktop computer:
\[ x = \frac{3}{4}x + 20 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ x - \frac{3}{4}x = 20 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4}x = 20 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 20 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

answer:  To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses for five days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day.
2. Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in five days.
3. Determine how many bags of oats are needed based on the total consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day:
- Each horse consumes 5 pounds per meal.
- Each horse is fed twice a day.
- Therefore, each horse consumes 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in five days:
- Each horse consumes 10 pounds/day * 5 days = 50 pounds.
- Therefore, four horses consume 50 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 200 pounds.

Finally, let's determine how many bags of oats are needed:
- Each bag contains 50 pounds.
- Therefore, 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

answer:  To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

Given:
- Weight of the 1959 penny = 48 grains
- Weight of the 2010 penny = three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny

First, calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Next, add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} + \text{Weight of the 1959 penny} = 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the pennies is 84 grains.

answer:  Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. Therefore, the total number of cookies Matt can have is:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{x}{2} \times 2 = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to allow for his goal of having 5 cookies.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides} \]

Now, we add the number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 621 \text{ people} \]

1. **Blue Paint:**
   - Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.
   - Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben.
   - Therefore, Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

2. **Yellow Paint:**
   - Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.

   - Therefore, Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total number of tubes:

\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = \text{Blue paint} + \text{Yellow paint} \]
\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = 2 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total tubes Jasper has} = 11 \]

1. Identify the highest temperatures for each country.
2. Add the highest temperatures together.
3. Divide the sum by the number of countries.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Next, we add these temperatures together:
\[ -48 + 21 + (-3) \]

First, add -48 and 21:
\[ -48 + 21 = -27 \]

Then, add -3 to the result:
\[ -27 + (-3) = -30 \]

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3):
\[ \frac{-30}{3} = -10 \]

So, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.
2. Multiply the number of oranges Stetson ate by the amount he gave up for each orange.

First, let's find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Stetson ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the oranges they picked. Since they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate as follows:

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
\]

Next, we know that Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate. Therefore, we multiply the number of oranges Stetson ate by the amount he gave up for each orange:

\[
\text{Total amount of money Stetson gave up} = 24 \times 10 = 240

answer:  Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is \( 200 + 5x \).

For the second venue:
- The cost per person is $25.
- Food is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second venue is \( 25x \).

To find the number of guests \( x \) that makes the two venues equal in cost, we set up the following equation:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

First, subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors

Next, apply the buy one get one free offer:
Since she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 packs of 4 razors each, which totals to 8 razors. However, with the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 4 razors.

Now, apply the $2.00 coupon:
The total cost before the coupon is 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00.
With the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Finally, calculate the cost per razor:
$6.00 / 4 razors = $1.50 per razor.

Convert the cost per razor to cents:
$1.50 * 100 = 150 cents.

So, each individual razor will cost 150 cents after the discount if Heather buys 2 packs of razors.

answer:  First, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in one day:
- Morning rides: 2
- Afternoon rides: 2
- Total rides per day: 2 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 4 rides

Next, calculate the total number of rides Paul takes in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days: 4 rides/day * 14 days = 56 rides

Now, calculate the cost of each type of ride:
- Morning ride cost: $6
- Afternoon ride cost: $2

Calculate the total cost for each type of ride:
- Total cost for morning rides: 56 rides * $6/ride = $336
- Total cost for afternoon rides: 56 rides * $2/ride = $112

Finally, calculate the total cost for all rides:
- Total cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $336 + $112 = $448

So, Paul spent $448 on driving his car during these 14 days.

answer:  To determine Angela's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Brett's current age.
2. Determine Brett's age in four years.
3. Calculate Angela's age in four years based on the given relationship.
4. Find Angela's current age by subtracting four years from her age in four years.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, Angela will be:
   \[
   3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years:
   \[
   42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn altogether.

answer:  Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \).

According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by all three is 43, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects.

Now, we can find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ \text{Lily's insects} = \frac{B}{2} + 7 = \frac{18}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \) dollars.

Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \) dollars.

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2.

She bought one pack of green apple gum for half the cost of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry, grape, and green apple gum:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

First, let's find the number of cows at the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
- Therefore, the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.

Next, let's find the number of sheep at the farm:
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
- Therefore, the farm has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) sheep.

Now, let's sum up the total number of animals at each location:
- The farm has \( 30 \) cows + \( 10 \) sheep = \( 40 \) animals.
- The zoo has \( 60 \) cows + \( 20 \) sheep = \( 80 \) animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \) animals.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Therefore, Rose bought \( 4O \) onions and \( 4P \) potatoes.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

Solving for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes:
\[ \text{Total onions and potatoes} = O + P \]
\[ \text{Total onions and potatoes} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market.

First, let's calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal:
- From December 31st to July 19th is 180 days.

Next, we need to determine the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit for 30 pounds is:
- 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

Now, we need to find the daily calorie deficit required to achieve this total deficit in 180 days. We do this by dividing the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
- 105,000 calories / 180 days = 578 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs to maintain a calorie deficit of 578 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by July 19th.

So, the answer is 578 calories per day.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ 3L = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost \(90,000\).

2 skeins (hat) + 4 skeins (scarf) + 12 skeins (sweater) + 2 skeins (mittens) + 4 skeins (socks) = 24 skeins per grandchild

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the skeins for one grandchild by 3:

24 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 72 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 72 skeins of wool.

answer:  First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts picked by all four per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29 quarts.

answer:  To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for both the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson buys 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for red tulips = 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson buys 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Number of rows for blue tulips = 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 rows (red tulips) + 3 rows (blue tulips) = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

answer:  To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of raisins used for one batch of oatmeal cookies.
2. Calculate the total amount of raisins available for oatmeal cookies.
3. Divide the total amount of raisins available by the amount used for one batch.

First, let's find out how many raisins are used for one batch of oatmeal cookies:
\[ \text{Raisins per batch} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ cup} \]

Next, we know that the jumbo bag contains 27 cups of raisins. Since Heather divides the bag equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use 27 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies.

Now, we divide the total amount of raisins available by the amount used for one batch:
\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 36 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the raisins.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ chairs} \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs each person has.

Ophelia has:
\[ 20 \text{ sofas} + 22 \text{ chairs} = 42 \text{ items} \]

Jenna has:
\[ 20 \text{ sofas} + 66 \text{ chairs} = 86 \text{ items} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:
\[ 42 \text{ items} + 86 \text{ items} = 128 \text{ items} \]

So, Ophelia and Jenna have 128 sofas and chairs.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.
- Jairus completed 20 tasks.
- Jairus's total earnings = $0.8/task * 20 tasks = $<<0.8*20=16>>16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.
- Jenny completed 20 tasks.
- Jenny's total earnings = $0.5/task * 20 tasks = $<<0.5*20=10>>10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Jairus's total earnings = $16
- Jenny's total earnings = $10
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $<<16-10=6>>6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

answer:  Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour per day.
The total daily consumption after adding the new device will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.
The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
To find the daily cost, we multiply the daily consumption by the cost per kilowatt per hour:
Daily cost = 12 kW/hour * $1.50/kW-hour = $18 per day
Daily cost after adding the new device = 14 kW/hour * $1.50/kW-hour = $21 per day
To find the weekly cost, we multiply the daily cost by 7 (the number of days in a week):
Weekly cost before adding the new device = $18/day * 7 days = $126
Weekly cost after adding the new device = $21/day * 7 days = $147
The difference between the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $147 - $126 = $21.

answer:  To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount Tom paid to find the cost of the CD.
3. Calculate how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.

First, let's assume the cost of the headphone set is \( H \). According to the problem, the total amount Tom paid is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ H = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have spent all $48 on the CD. The cost of one CD is $4, so the number of additional CDs he could have bought with $48 is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 12 more CDs if he decided not to buy the headphone set.

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, James is currently 22 years old.

Next, we need to find out James's cousin's age in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, James's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James's age. Therefore, twice James's age is:

\[ 2 \times 22 = 44 \]

In 8 years, James's cousin will be 5 years younger than this amount:

\[ 44 - 5 = 39 \]

So, in 8 years, James's cousin will be 39 years old. Therefore, James's cousin is currently:

\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Now, we calculate the age difference between James and his cousin:

\[ 31 - 22 = 9 \]

So, the age difference between James and his cousin is 9 years.

2. Determine the cost of the printer.
3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer.
4. Subtract the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent.
5. Divide the remaining amount by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

1. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
2. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.
3. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.
4. The total amount spent is $2,400, so the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

- The first half of April has 15 days.
- The second half of April has 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

answer:  To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day.
2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week.

First, let's calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day:
- Jeff's work is 3 miles away.
- He walks to work and back each day.
- Therefore, the total distance he walks in one day is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week:
- Jeff works 5 days a week.
- He walks 6 miles each day.
- Therefore, the total distance he walks in one week is:
  \[
  6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

So, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{30 \text{ miles}}
\]

answer:  Elise writes the full alphabet twice, which is \( 2 \times 26 = 52 \) letters.
She then writes half of the alphabet once, which is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
Next, she re-writes everything she has already written. Since she has already written 52 letters and 13 letters, she will write these letters again.

So, the total number of letters she writes is:
- The full alphabet twice: \( 2 \times 26 = 52 \) letters
- Half of the alphabet once: \( 13 \) letters
- Re-writing everything she has already written: \( 52 + 13 = 65 \) letters

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, Elise has written a total of 130 letters.

answer:  To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles needed for each son.
2. Determine the total number of candles needed.
3. Calculate the number of packs required.
4. Calculate the total cost.

1. The older son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, he needs 8 candles.
3. The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.
4. Each pack contains 5 candles. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
   \]
5. Each pack costs $3. Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

James spends \boxed{12} on candles.

answer:  To calculate Antonella's commission for selling goods worth $2500, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 in sales and the commission for the remaining $1500.

1. Commission for the first $1000 in sales:
   - Antonella earns a 30% commission on the first $1000 in sales.
   - Commission for the first $1000 = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. Commission for the remaining $1500 in sales:
   - Antonella earns a 10% commission on the remaining $1500 in sales.
   - Commission for the remaining $1500 = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:
- Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission for selling goods worth $2500.

Final answer: $450

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator: 1 * $12 = $12
- One geometry set: 1 * $10 = $10

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

answer:  To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set.
2. Calculate how many more toys Jonathan needs to reach this total.
3. Subtract the additional toys he needs from the total required to find out how many toys he currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times larger would be:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(398\) toys.

answer:  To determine the total cost of lunch at Subway, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Given:
- The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
- The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

First, calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} \]
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to sum up the amounts received for each set of teeth lost.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, she received $1.00 each, so the total for these three teeth is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]
3. For the last two teeth, she received half the amount of money she received for each of the first three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the first three teeth, she received $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. Therefore, the total for the last two teeth is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
   \]

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[

answer:  When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Therefore, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in:

\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a warm day.

On a cold day:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a warm day:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time is:
\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters per cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:

Given:
- Total number of buttons = 21
- Number of buttons with two holes = 7

The rest of the buttons have four holes:
- Number of buttons with four holes = Total number of buttons - Number of buttons with two holes
- Number of buttons with four holes = 21 - 7 = 14

Next, calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons:
- Total holes from buttons with two holes = Number of buttons with two holes * Number of holes per button
- Total holes from buttons with two holes = 7 * 2 = 14

- Total holes from buttons with four holes = Number of buttons with four holes * Number of holes per button
- Total holes from buttons with four holes = 14 * 4 = 56

Finally, add the total holes from both types of buttons to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:
- Total holes = 14 + 56 = 70

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

1. **Initial angle of the pyramid:**
   The pyramid sits at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of the sun's movement:**
   The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time the sun is moving:**
   The sun is moving for 10 hours.

4. **Total angle moved by the sun:**
   Total angle moved by the sun = Rate of movement × Time
   Total angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour × 10 hours = 50 degrees

5. **Total angle from the ground to the sun:**
   Total angle from the ground to the sun = Initial angle of the pyramid + Total angle moved by the sun
   Total angle from the ground to the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Therefore, after 10 hours, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees.

The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3.00B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3.00} \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1.01B - 0.99B = 15 \]

So, the answer is 15.

answer:  Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Therefore, he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 each day, which totals to $10 * 3 days = $30.

He spends $30 on wooden action figures, and each wooden action figure costs $5. Therefore, he can buy $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week, he spends $10 each day for 4 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), which totals to $10 * 4 days = $40.

He spends $40 on plastic action figures, and each plastic action figure costs $2. Therefore, he can buy $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

To find the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week, we add the number of wooden action figures to the number of plastic action figures:

Total action figures = 6 wooden + 20 plastic
Total action figures = 26 figures

answer:  To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total costs, then find the difference.

1. **Total Revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Total Costs:**
   - The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, they need 1 loaf of bread for 10 sandwiches, which costs $3.00.
   - The cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.
   - Total costs = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

3. **Net Profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, the food truck's net profit is $37.00.

answer:  Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2(J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = <<10 + 3=13>>13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

answer:  To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes over the 2-year period and then subtract that from the initial amount in her account.

First, let's calculate the total amount Katina removes in 2 years:
- She removes $100 every month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Over 2 years, there are \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.

Now, multiply the amount removed per month by the number of months:
\[ 100 \times 24 = 2400 \]

So, Katina removes $2400 in 2 years.

Next, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her account:
- Initial amount: $3000
- Amount removed: $2400

Remaining amount:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \]

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

answer:  To determine the correct temperature for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off.

First, let's find the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature:
\[ \text{Difference} = 468 - 450 = 18 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage off:
\[ \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100\% = 4\% \]

Now, we know the oven is off by 4%. To find the correct temperature for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to adjust it by the same percentage.

Calculate the adjustment:
\[ \text{Adjustment} = \left( \frac{4}{100} \right) \times 520 = 20.8 \]

Add this adjustment to the required temperature:
\[ \text{Correct temperature} = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees for her recipe.

answer:  To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the number of birds he saw each day:

- Day 1: 50 birds
- Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4: 120 birds
- Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 470 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:

Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
Average birds per day = 470 birds / 7 days
Average birds per day ≈ 67.14 birds per day

Therefore, on average, Mack saw approximately 67 birds in a day.

answer:  To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the lengths of both movies into minutes and then add them together.

1. Convert the length of the first movie to minutes:
   - The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

2. Convert the length of the second movie to minutes:
   - The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 2 * 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

3. Add the lengths of both movies together:
   - Total time = 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

4. **Day 4:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.
5. **Day 5:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) feet tall.

On Day 5, the beanstalk is 64 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 5 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\) or 5 days.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:

1. Each implant has a base price of $2000.
2. George needs 2 implants, so the base cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\).
3. One of the implants has an additional cost of $500 for the crown, so the total cost for the implants is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\).
4. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\).

Next, we need to determine how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900:

1. George makes $15 per hour.
2. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: \(3900 \div 15 = 260\) hours.

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

answer:  John received initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. His research took 10 times as long, so it took 10 * 5 = 50 months.

For the first 5 months, he received $100,000 per month, so the total cost for these months is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

For the remaining 45 months, he received 50% more funding per month. This means he received $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 per month.

The total cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Therefore, the total cost of his research is $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

John's research cost $7,250,000.

answer:  To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week) to get the weekly protein intake.

First, let's find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:
- A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will have:
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 200 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams}
  \]

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake:
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the weekly protein intake is:
  \[
  6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week}

answer:  Let the smallest angle in the triangle be \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is \( \boxed{90} degrees.

answer:  To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new weight after a 50% increase.
2. Adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the increased weight.

First, let's calculate the new weight after a 50% increase:

- The original weight is 8 pounds.
- A 50% increase of 8 pounds is calculated as follows:
  \[
  50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}
  \]
- Adding this increase to the original weight:
  \[
  8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, we adjust the weight by subtracting 2 pounds from the increased weight:

- The increased weight is 12 pounds.
- Subtracting 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
  \[
  12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

answer:  To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection:
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections:
- There are 4 intersections.
- Therefore, the total number of street lights for all intersections is \( 24 \times 4 = 96 \).

Finally, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:
- There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
- Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is \( 96 - 20 = 76 \).

In the first year, he buys 1 game per month, so he buys 1 * 12 = 12 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 10 + 12 + 5 = 27 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 27 + 24 + 5 = 56 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so he buys 4 * 12 = 48 games. Adding the 5 games for Christmas, he has 56 + 48 + 5 = 109 games.

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has 109 games.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Now, let's convert the total amount from cents to dollars:
345 cents = 3.45 dollars

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 0.05 dollars, we can determine how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

3.45 dollars / 0.05 dollars/gumball = 69 gumballs

2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we add up the amounts spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, he has:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

- Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours.
- The price per cup is $0.60.
- Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for all six hours:

answer:  To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to find the plane's speed.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{2000}{400} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

\[ \text{Discounted price of the shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's add the cost of the pair of shorts. The price of the shorts is $35.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Now, let's determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase. Joe starts with $50.

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so in one year, he drives:
\[ 400 \text{ miles/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 4800 \text{ miles/year} \]

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the number of rotations per year is:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water for the year.

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used per week:
- Gary does laundry twice a week.
- Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- Therefore, the total water used per week = 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Therefore, the total water used per year = 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the water for the year:
- Each gallon of water costs $0.15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the year = 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

So, Gary spends $312 on water for his laundry needs in a year.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.

So, the total amount of meat sold in one day is:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} = 150 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat sold in one day:
\[ 750 \text{ kg} \div 150 \text{ kg/day} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

answer:  First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \times 3 \text{ seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

After the administrators occupy their seats, the number of remaining seats is:
\[ 72 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 54 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 \text{ seats} = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Finally, the rest of the seats are occupied by the students:
\[ 54 \text{ seats} - 18 \text{ seats} = 36 \text{ seats} \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

answer:  To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play count for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. **DVD 1:**
   - Total play count: 1000 times
   - Plays already made: 356 times
   - Remaining play count: 1000 - 356 = 644 times

2. **DVD 2:**
   - Total play count: 1000 times
   - Plays already made: 135 times
   - Remaining play count: 1000 - 135 = 865 times

Now, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
- Remaining play count for DVD 1: 644 times
- Remaining play count for DVD 2: 865 times

Total remaining play count: 644 + 865 = 1509 times

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509 times.

1. Calculate the total number of sessions John went to physical therapy.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent in physical therapy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the cost per hour.

1. **Total number of sessions:**
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he went twice, so the total number of sessions is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) sessions.

2. **Total number of hours spent in physical therapy:**
   - Each session lasts 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) hours.

3. **Total cost of the physical therapy:**
   - The cost per hour is $125.
   - The total cost is the total number of hours multiplied by the cost per hour.
   - So, the total cost is \( 24 \times 125 = 3000 \) dollars.

The total cost of the physical therapy is $3000.

answer:  To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the first website:
- The first website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the first website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the second website:
- The second website publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day.
- There are 28 days in February.
- Total articles by the second website = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:
- Total articles by both websites = 560 articles (first website) + 280 articles (second website) = 840 articles.

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is \(\boxed{840}\).

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. The school day lasts 8 hours, so he chews:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

After chewing 4 pieces at school, he has:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces left} \]

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

After chewing 2 more pieces, he has:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces left} \]

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:

After giving 7 pieces to his sister, he has:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces left} \]

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the rate of soil through clay, which is 2 feet per hour. He needs to dig 8 feet.

\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add the time for digging through the soil and the time for digging through the clay to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for soil} + \text{Time for clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb. Therefore, to convert 20 kb per second to Mb per second, we divide 20 by 1000:

\[ 20 \text{ kb/second} \div 1000 \text{ kb/Mb} = 0.002 \text{ Mb/second} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed by 3600:

\[ 0.002 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 7.2 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 7.2 Mb per hour.

answer:  To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them.

First, let's find the relative speed between Tom and Bob:
- Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
- Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour
Relative speed = 15 miles per hour

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap at a relative speed of 15 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

Time = (75 ÷ 5) / (15 ÷ 5)
Time = 15 / 3

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

answer:  First, let's calculate the 5% raise on Tim's $20,000 monthly salary:

\[ \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, he receives a bonus worth half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

Finally, let's calculate his annual income:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, Tim will make $372000 in a year.

answer:  James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

He buys 10 dress pants, and each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
Cost of one dress pant = 1/5 * $750 = $150.
Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/pant = $1500.

He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and each dress shirt costs $60.
Total cost for dress shirts = 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit * $60/shirt = $1800.

To find the total cost of everything, we add the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
Total cost = $7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $10800.

answer:  To find the total distance Alisa and Stanley biked, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then sum those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Distance Alisa = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance Stanley = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances Alisa and Stanley biked to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance Alisa + Distance Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.

answer:  To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags.

First, let's find the total amount of flour in one bag:
- Each bag is divided into 8 portions.
- Each portion weighs 2 kilograms.

So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags:
- There are 3 bags.

So, the total amount of flour in three bags is:
\[ 16 \text{ kg/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[ 48 \text{ kg} \]

The final answer is 48 kilograms.

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine how many whole eggs are required for those deviled egg halves.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

Next, we need to determine how many whole eggs are required for those deviled egg halves:
- Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
- Therefore, 48 halves will require 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 whole eggs.

Finally, we convert the number of whole eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Total dozens of eggs = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

1. **Cooking time for rice:**
   - Rice: 30 minutes

2. **Cooking time for pork:**
   - Pork takes 20 more minutes to cook than rice.
   - Therefore, pork takes 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.

3. **Cooking time for beans:**
   - Beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, beans take 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook.

4. **Total cooking time:**
   - Rice: 30 minutes
   - Pork: 50 minutes
   - Beans: 40 minutes
   - Total cooking time: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the legs information, we can write:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

From the heads information, we can write:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Substitute \( G = 20 - S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

answer:  Let's denote the age of one triplet as \( x \).

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + 2(x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 7 + 2x + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 4x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 23 \]

Divide by 4:

\[ x = 5.75 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 5.75 years.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

\[ 5.75 + 7 = 12.75 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is \( 12.75 \) years old.

Now, add up all the money they have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, we divide the total amount by the number of people:

\[ \text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120 if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week (7 days), so he needs 7 pounds of coffee.

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Roger buys a donut for $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for everything is $44.

answer:  First, we need to find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert's candy: 3 pounds
Cindy's candy: 5 pounds
Aaron's candy: 4 pounds

Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Next, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people to find out how much each person would get.

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and John needs 2 vaccines:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's determine the total bill including the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:

\[ 0.6T = 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{40}{0.6} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is:

\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying $80 for the vaccines and heartworm check, he will have:

\[ 125 - 80 = 45 \]

Therefore, John leaves the vet with $45.

answer:  To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to account for the good days she has already had and subtract them from the total number of days in the month.

First, let's count the total number of good days she has had so far:
- Her first eight days were good.
- Her next eight days were bad.
- Her third eight days were neutral.
- Her next three days were good, neutral, and good.

So, the total number of good days she has had is:
\[ 8 + 1 + 3 = 12 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of days in the month:
- The month has 30 days.

Now, we subtract the number of good days she has had from the total number of days in the month to find the number of good days left:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

So, the number of good days left in the month is \( \boxed{18} \).

answer:  First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. We know the bamboo grows up to 30 inches per day.

The total growth needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows up to 30 inches per day, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount:

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after Frances's investment:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the money:

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 1200 - 480 - 480 = 240 \]

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

answer:  Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

First, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, the new length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Next, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. So, the final length of the dress is:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The original dress was originally 80 cm long.

First, let's add up the time spent on each subject:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total time spent on homework = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, we need to convert the total time John has before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:

answer:  To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops she buys, she gets 3 scoops in total.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for every 3 scoops she buys, she pays 3 scoops * $1.50/scoop = $4.50.

Erin has $6.00, so we need to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00.

$6.00 / $4.50 = 1.3333

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 full set of 3 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 1 set of 3 scoops, which means she will get 3 scoops in total.

answer:  To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs she currently has and then compare it to the total number of people attending the function.

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   - Mia has 8 high chairs.
   - The number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**
   - Mia has 8 high chairs.
   - Mia has 40 regular chairs.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs is \( 8 + 40 = 48 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of people attending the function:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \( 42 + 15 = 57 \).

Since Mia currently has 48 chairs and needs to accommodate 57 people, she does not have enough chairs.

**Answer:** Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

answer:  To determine the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the fruits:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \]

Therefore, the price for the crate of fruit is \boxed{32}.

answer:  To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of squares of each color and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of squares of each color to find the total area of the comforter:
\[
\text{Total area} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

answer:  First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam: 50 points
2. Betty: 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points
3. Tom: 65 - 30 = 35 points
4. Marta: 3 * 35 = 105 points

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Marta: 105 points

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:

400 points - 255 points = 145 points

Therefore, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

answer:  To find the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price per computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers.

First, let's calculate the new price per computer:

The original price per computer is $700. A 10% increase means the price increases by 10% of $700.

\[ \text{Increase} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new price is:

1. Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
2. Subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck's capacity.

First, we know Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck can carry:
\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is:
\[ 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry:
\[ 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds.

answer:  To determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sacks Goldy gave to her cousin and brother.
2. Determine the weight of the rice in each sack.
3. Multiply the number of sacks given by the weight per sack to find the total weight.

First, let's find the total number of sacks given:
- Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- Goldy gave 4 sacks to her brother.

Total sacks given = 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks.

Next, we know the weight of the rice in each sack:
- Each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice.

Now, we multiply the number of sacks given by the weight per sack to find the total weight:
Total weight = Number of sacks given × Weight per sack
Total weight = 7 sacks × 25 kg/sack
Total weight = 175 kg

Therefore, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

The final answer is 175 kilograms.

- Aiden
- 12 friends
- 7 more friends

Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20

Next, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed. Each person will have:
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Total drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks. Each drink and snack costs $2:

Cost of drinks = 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
Cost of snacks = 60 snacks * $2/snap = $120

Finally, we add the costs of the drinks and snacks to find the total amount spent:

Total cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks
Total cost = $80 + $120 = $200

Therefore, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks.

answer:  To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial number of chairs.

1. **Initial number of normal chairs:**
   - The restaurant has 170 normal chairs.
   - 20 normal chairs are sent for repair.
   - Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is:
     \[
     170 - 20 = 150
     \]

2. **Initial number of baby chairs:**
   - The restaurant has 23 baby chairs.
   - 13 baby chairs are sent for repair.
   - Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is:
     \[
     23 - 13 = 10
     \]

3. **Total number of chairs left:**
   - The total number of chairs left is the sum of the remaining normal chairs and the remaining baby chairs.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs left is:
     \[
     150 + 10 = 160

answer:  First, determine the total amount of money they need to raise after the first 3 hours:

\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised} \]
\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, calculate the amount they need to raise per hour:

\[ \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount needed}}{\text{Number of hours}} \]
\[ \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{4200}{3} = 1400 \]

Now, determine the total number of hours required to raise the remaining $4200:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount needed}}{\text{Amount per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = \frac{4200}{1400} = 3 \]

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 6 hours to reach their goal of $6300.

answer:  First, we need to determine how much money each person received based on the given ratio.

The ratio of the money divided between Gerald and Julia is 3:2. This means for every 3 parts that Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts.

The total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.

To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount of money by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we calculate Gerald's share:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate Julia's share:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his initial share:
\[ \text{Gerald's remaining money} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left after spending $10.

\[ \text{Cat's speed} = 5 \times \text{Turtle's speed} \]

Given that the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can solve for the turtle's speed:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \quad \text{feet/second} \]

Next, calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \quad \text{feet/second} \times 40 \quad \text{seconds} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \quad \text{feet} \]

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

answer:  To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom.
2. Multiply the calculated area by the number of tiles needed per square foot.

First, let's find two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom:

\[ \text{Two-thirds of 36 sq ft} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, we multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot:

\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \times 24 = 576 \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \$5 - \$2 = \$3 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times \$5 = \$50 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times \$3 = \$48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs for both types of jars to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$50 + \$48 = \$98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98.

answer:  To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the total cost of fixing the pothole to the potential damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
- The fine for fixing the pothole is $120.
- The cost of the asphalt is 3 buckets × $25/bucket = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:
\[ $120 + $75 = $195 \]

Next, let's consider the potential damage to the car if the pothole doesn't get fixed:
- The damage to the car is $450.

Now, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to the car:
\[ $450 - $195 = $255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

answer:  Each person ordered one pizza, so there are a total of 5 pizzas.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so there are a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each.

Since there are 3 people (Bryce and his two friends), they ate a total of 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each.

Since there are 2 people, they ate a total of 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

- Left foot: 250 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute: 300 + 250 = 550 taps

Next, let's calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with her arms raised:

- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute: 200 + 200 = 400 taps

Now, let's calculate the total number of taps over 5 minutes:

- Taps with arms at sides: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
- Taps with arms raised: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 90 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 104 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem:

\[ 104 = 9x + 10 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ 94 = 9x \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{94}{9} = 10.4 \]

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10.4 inches long.

answer:  To determine how much money the vendor saves in a week, we need to calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor and the new vendor, then find the difference, and finally convert that to a weekly savings.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.50.
- Daily cost from old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.50 per tomato = $250.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Each tomato costs $0.40.
- Daily cost from new vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.40 per tomato = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings:
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, let's convert the daily savings to a weekly savings:
- Weekly savings = $50/day * 7 days/week = $350.

answer:  To find the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat.

So, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:
\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the total time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
\[ \text{Total time} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of animals (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the average time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is \( 25 \) minutes.

1. Dora's age is given as 15 years.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \text{ years}

The total number of students who like to either play video games or play music is the total number of students minus those who like to bake and those who like to play basketball:
\[ V + M = 50 - 10 - 5 \]
\[ V + M = 35 \]

Substitute \( M = 10 \) into the equation:
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]

Solve for \( V \):
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

\( \boxed{25} \)

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 small cubes * 1/2 ounce per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After using 30 ounces, he will have:

32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces left.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, each class has:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

answer:  Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed by the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles, and the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed by all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs \( x \) cases of shingles, the third house also needs 100 cases of shingles.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

answer:  To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to find the total number of animals she needs to groom and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the total number of animals:
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12

   Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

2. Determine the number of days in a week:
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. Divide the total number of animals by the number of days:
   Animals per day = Total animals / Number of days
   Animals per day = 28 / 7

4. Perform the division:
   28 / 7 ≈ 4.2857

Since we can't have a fraction of an animal in this context, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Melissa will groom approximately 4 animals each day.

#### 4 animals per day.

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

answer:  To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Determine the cost of the oranges.

First, let's find out how many oranges are needed for 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice, for 4 liters:

\[ \text{Amount of oranges needed} = 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so for 20 kilograms:

\[ \text{Cost of oranges} = 20 \, \text{kg} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/kg} = 60 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

answer:  Mark buys 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

He gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

He also gets 30 more cards with an average value of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is:
\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

The total value of all the cards is:
\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the packs from the total value of the cards:

The total number of students is 54, and they are to be separated into 6 groups. Therefore, the number of students per group is:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the 12 groups required for the activity. Since each group has 9 students, the total number of students in 12 groups is:
\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate the remaining students. The total number of students is 54, and 108 students are already accounted for, so the number of remaining students is:
\[ 54 - 108 = -54 \]

Since the number of students cannot be negative, it means there are actually 54 more students than required. Therefore, no additional groups are needed. The 12 groups can already accommodate all the students.

Thus, no more groups are needed.

answer:  Let \( x \) represent the number of votes against the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be represented as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33. Therefore, the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against must equal the total number of people on the council:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

1. Calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.
2. Subtract the number of broken glasses and plates.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen equals \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) glasses.
- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen equals \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) plates.

Next, we subtract the number of broken glasses and plates:

- Jeff sent 96 glasses and 10 were broken, so the number of remaining glasses is \( 96 - 10 = 86 \) glasses.
- Jeff sent 48 plates and 6 were broken, so the number of remaining plates is \( 48 - 6 = 42 \) plates.

Therefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

- Half of their driving speed: 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
- Hiking speed: 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour
- Hiking time: 1.5 hours
- Distance hiked: 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Finally, let's calculate the total distance to their vacation spot:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has after receiving money from Ava.
2. Subtract the cost of the camera from the total amount of money Jayden has.

First, let's find out how much money Ava gave Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance:
\[ \text{Amount Ava gave} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, we add the amount Ava gave to Jayden's initial amount:
\[ \text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the cost of the camera from the total amount Jayden has:
\[ \text{Amount needed} = 115 - 200 = -85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The negative sign indicates that Jayden is actually short by $85, meaning he would need an additional $85 to purchase the camera.

answer:  Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( x \).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 17 fish, the total number of fish he has is \( 3 + 4 + 17 = 24 \).

Let \( y \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought. According to the problem, after buying the fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, the number of orange fish he bought is \( 2x \).

The total number of fish after buying the new fish is \( 3 + 4 + x + 2x = 7 + 3x \).

We know that the total number of fish after buying the new fish is 24, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 7 + 3x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 - 7 \]
\[ 3x = 17 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Bob bought \( x = 5 \) white fish at the store.

answer:  To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Determine the total number of puppies based on the given information.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as \( P \).

\[
\frac{1}{3}P = 6
\]

Solving for \( P \):

\[
P = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

So, there are 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as \( T \).

\[
\frac{2}{3}T = 18
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

\[
\boxed{27}
\]

answer:  To determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marissa had initially.
2. Subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount to find out how much money she has left.
3. Divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars she bought.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Marissa initially had $80.
2. She bought a ball for $20, so we subtract $20 from $80:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   So, Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball.
3. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, we divide $60 by $5:
   \[
   60 \div 5 = 12
   \]
   So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

Therefore, the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy is \(\boxed{12} \).

answer:  To determine the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books read by Ahmed.
2. Calculate the total number of books read by Ezra.
3. Add the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2 \times \text{Number of books read by Ahmed} = 300 \]
\[ \text{Number of books read by Ahmed} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we know that Ezra read 300 books initially and then read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books read by Ezra is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Finally, we add the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is 600.

answer:  To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. **Number of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

2. **Number of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \)

3. **Number of OLED TVs:**
   - The rest of the sales are OLED TVs.
   - Total TVs sold = 40
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - 15
   - Number of OLED TVs = 25

Therefore, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

answer:  To determine the total number of fruits George has, we need to calculate the number of pears and then add it to the number of bananas.

First, let's find the number of pears. George has 45% more pears than bananas. He has 200 bananas.

\[ \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 45\% \text{ of number of bananas} \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 \]

\[ \text{Number of pears} = 290 \]

Now, we add the number of bananas to the number of pears to find the total number of fruits.

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 200 + 290 \]

answer:  To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold.
2. Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold.
3. Find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- There are 4 vanilla scents available.
- Each vanilla scent is sold 5 times.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 4 vanilla scents * 5 sales per vanilla scent = 20 vanilla scents.

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- There are 8 fruity scents available.
- Each fruity scent is sold 2 times.
- Total fruity scents sold = 8 fruity scents * 2 sales per fruity scent = 16 fruity scents.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

answer:  Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is (1/3) * 9 = 3 hours.

Therefore, she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.5 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

1. **First 5 days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days.
   - Total rides in first 5 days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - They ride twice the times they do on usual days.
   - Since they ride 3 times on a usual day, twice the usual times means they ride 3 * 2 = 6 times a day.
   - Total rides in next 2 days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides in a week = Total rides in first 5 days + Total rides in next 2 days

answer:  Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in various series, so he has 600/3 = 200 series movies.
A normal movie costs $10, so the cost of the series movies is 200 * $10 = $2000.
He can buy the series movies for $6 off the normal price, so the cost of each series movie is $10 - $6 = $4.
The cost of the series movies is 200 * $4 = $800.
The remaining movies are older, so he has 600 - 200 = 400 older movies.
40% of these movies are older, so he has 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.
Each older movie costs $5, so the cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

2. Determine how many square inches he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the height.

First, let's find the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches he can make with 144 chips:

answer:  To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will cover.
3. Calculate how much John has after the school's contribution.
4. Subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip to find out how much he is missing.

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school will cover:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. John has $50, so after the school's contribution, he will have:
   \[
   50 + 150 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip:
   \[
   300 - 200 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The answer is $100.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many 9-person groups were formed from the 90 people.

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had this characteristic.

\[
\text{Number of groups with 2 seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by these 6 groups. Each group has 9 members, and each member brings 2 seashells.

\[
\text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Since there are 6 such groups:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108
\]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by the members of these groups is:

\[
\boxed{108}

answer:  Carrie was given ten twenties, which is equivalent to 10 * $20 = $200.
She was also given 140 quarters, which is equivalent to 140 * $0.25 = $35.
Carrie spent all the quarters, so she spent $35 on the quarters.
She also spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is (3/5) * $200 = $120.
Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is $35 + $120 = $155.

answer:  To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the total value of the bottle caps in a 30-day month.

First, let's calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total number of bottle caps he finds in a 30-day month is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of these bottle caps:
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

So, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

answer:  To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, let's find the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week. Since each branch costs $0.25 and he made $105 in a week, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total amount made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (which is 7) to find the average number of branches per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

1. Calculate the temperature during the night.
2. Determine the temperature difference between the day and the night.
3. Calculate the number of logs needed to heat the house by the required temperature difference.

1. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
2. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:
   \[
   45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}
   \]
3. The temperature difference between the day and the night is:
   \[
   32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees}

answer:  Billy's initial hourly wage is $10.00. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial hourly wage, so her hourly wage is $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, Billy's total earnings will be $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.00.
Sally's total earnings will be $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.00.

Therefore, Billy will earn $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00 more than Sally.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of salt as \( S \) ounces. According to the problem, Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2S \) ounces.

She also uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so the amount of fragrance is \( S \) ounces.

She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so the amount of sugar is \( S \) ounces.

The total volume of the salt scrub is the sum of all the ingredients:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 6S \]

We know that the total volume of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so:
\[ 6S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, Tanya uses:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \] ounces of oil.

answer:  Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours of work each day. For any additional hours, she is paid at a rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the additional hours. Jamie worked a total of 11 hours, so she worked 3 additional hours beyond the first 8 hours.

The special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is:
\[ 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, calculate her earnings for the additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, add her earnings from the first 8 hours and the additional hours:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals.

Next, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she should buy so that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of her total stuffed animals.

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of this total:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

answer:  To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

**First car:**
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours
- Distance = 120 miles

**Second car:**
- Speed: 70 miles per hour
- Time: 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours
- Distance = 140 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Difference = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
- Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles
- Difference = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

So, the distance separating the two cars after 2 hours is 20 miles.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Pass rate = 2 * 40% = 80%

Now, we find the average of these pass rates:
- Average pass rate = (68% + 40% + 80%) / 3
- Average pass rate = 188% / 3
- Average pass rate = 62.67%

The school's overall pass rate is approximately 62.67%.

- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each class has 3 teachers.

Total number of students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Finally, we add the trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Next, let's account for the fact that Rose dropped 1 flower from each type:

- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Adding these up:
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

answer:  The base installation cost is $129.00, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

First, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela has:
- Mirrors: 6
- Chandeliers: 2
- Pictures: 20

Total additional items = 6 + 2 + 20 = 28 items

Next, we calculate the cost for the additional items. Each additional item costs $15.00:
- Cost for additional items = 28 items * $15.00/item = $420.00

Finally, we add the cost of the additional items to the base installation cost:
- Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost for additional items
- Total cost = $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela to have all the items installed and hung is $549.00.

answer:  Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, so he can play for 4 hours / 20 minutes = 2 quarters.
Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes each.
One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes.
The total time they all play together is 2 hours + 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 4 hours.
Since they play for 4 hours, they use 4 hours / 20 minutes = 2 quarters.
Therefore, they use 2 quarters in total.

answer:  Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150 of them. So, he had:

\[ 100 - 150 = -50 \]

This means Dale sold 50 butterscotch candies before he ordered any more. Then, he ordered 100 more butterscotch candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we need to add the candies he ordered to the candies he has already sold:

\[ -50 + 100 = 50 \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

answer:  To determine the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Total cost for goats = \(3 \times 500 = 1500\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Total cost for cows = \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\).

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost for goats = $1500
- Total cost for cows = $3000
- Total amount spent = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\).

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4500}

answer:  First, let's determine how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, after selling and giving away some cars, Joe remains with:

\[ 16 \text{ cars} \]

The answer is 16 cars.

answer:  To solve this problem, we need to compare the speeds of the kangaroos and the turtles.

First, let's determine the speed of one kangaroo. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, then the speed of one kangaroo is:
\[ \text{Speed of one kangaroo} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ kangaroos}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is:
\[ \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to travel across the highway. If one turtle takes 3 hours to travel across the highway, then four turtles will take:
\[ \text{Time for four turtles} = 4 \text{ turtles} \times 3 \text{ hours per turtle} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 12 hours to travel across the highway.

- DeSean makes 9 S'mores.
- Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Next, let's account for the marshmallows dropped on the ground:
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.
- Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:
- The bag originally had 35 marshmallows.
- Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Finally, let's determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows:
- Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow.
- Each kid can have 14 marshmallows / 2 kids = 7 S'mores.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Add the times from both days to get the total time.

First, let's calculate the time Sandy walked on the first day:
- Sandy walked for 8 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day:
- Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day.
- Half of 8 hours is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.
- 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's add the times from both days:
- Total time = 480 minutes (first day) + 240 minutes (second day) = 720 minutes.

Therefore, Sandy spent a total of 720 minutes walking over the two days.

1. Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day.
2. Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

First, let's calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Therefore, the number of tasks per day = 30 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Next, let's calculate the number of tasks John completes in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the number of tasks per week = 150 tasks/day * 7 days = 1050 tasks/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for the week:
- Each task pays $1.20.
- Therefore, the total earnings for the week = 1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260.

answer:  To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to add 2 more cows to his herd, making a total of 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food:
- Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
- Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than tins of dog food.

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

answer:  To determine how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large apples.
2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small apples.
3. Add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices.
4. Subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- Total slices from large apples = 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- Total slices from small apples = 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, add the slices from the large and small apples:
- Total slices = 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

answer:  To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of lifting abilities from Pompei to Naruto.

1. **Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.**
2. **Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) inches.
3. **Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) inches.
4. **Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami.**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain \( 48 \times 10 = 480 \) inches.

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Naruto can lift a mountain \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

answer:  Let's denote your brother's age as \( B \).

According to the problem:
- You are three years younger than your brother, so your age is \( B - 3 \).
- You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is \( B - 3 - 2 = B - 5 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).

The sum of all your ages is given as 87:
\[ B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

So, your brother is 16 years old. Your age is \( B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \).

Therefore, you are 13 years old.

answer:  To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum them up.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(16\) millimeters.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, let's calculate the amount of tips Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply $800 by 0.10:

\[ 800 \times 0.10 = 80 \]

Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so she received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, let's find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1520 in tips altogether.

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Erika already has in her purse as \( S \).

The original price of the laptop is $600, and after trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika has been paid $150 from her part-time job and her mom will give her $80. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have is:
\[ S + 150 + 80 = S + 230 \]

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which costs $400. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have is:
\[ S + 230 = 400 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \):
\[ S + 230 = 400 \]
\[ S = 400 - 230 \]
\[ S = 170 \]

So, Erika has $170 in her purse.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of socks Jack has. Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, the number of socks Peter has is:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

We also know that Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, the number of dishes Peter has is:

\[ \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Peter and Jack have a total of 90 socks and 90 dishes in total.

- Total concert time: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes
- Total available time: 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Next, let's determine the time each group takes to perform:

- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes
- Total time per group: 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many groups can perform in the concert:

- Total available time: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes
- Number of groups: 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 11 groups.

Therefore, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

answer:  To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to find the number of silver coins and then add the number of gold coins.

Given:
- Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = S + 30 \]

Substituting the given number of gold coins:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

1. **First Year:**
   - The town builds 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - The town builds three times as many homes as in the first year.
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - The town counts the total number of homes built so far and doubles that amount.
   - The total number of homes built in the first two years is \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the town will have built a total of \( {144} \) homes over the next three years.

answer:  First, determine the number of rooms to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms is:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

answer:  To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos given to the students and Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract this total from the total number of burritos ordered:

answer:  Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

According to the problem:
1. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

The total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

answer:  To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount of water:**
   - The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After a day of heavy rain:**
   - The amount of water passing through the river doubles.
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is:
     \[
     4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **On the third day:**
   - The volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is:
     \[
     8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[

answer:  To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to account for the increased runtime of her final concert and the encore.

Let's denote the length of her usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the length of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes.

Additionally, she performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the concert. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the final concert and the encore:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]

\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes each.

\[ \text{Total cost per week} = \frac{400 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 100 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, calculate Madeline's share of the cost per week:
\[ \text{Madeline's share per week} = 60\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ dollars} = 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the cost per week:
\[ \text{Keenan's share per week} = 40\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ dollars} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is \( \frac{21}{7} = $3.00 \).

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water:
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is \( \frac{8}{4} = $2.00 \).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
- The cost of 3 bottles of soda is \( 3 \times 3.00 = $9.00 \).
- The cost of 2 bottles of water is \( 2 \times 2.00 = $4.00 \).

Adding these together gives the total cost:
- $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $130.

answer:  To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add up the birds he sees in each category:

1. **Birds in the bushes:** Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. **Birds flying overhead:** Jerry counts \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of birds in the bushes. Since there are 6 birds in the bushes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds flying overhead}
   \]
3. **Birds feeding:** Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. First, we calculate the total number of birds feeding:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds feeding}
   \]

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[
6 \text{ (birds in the bushes)} + 4 \text{ (birds flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (birds feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds}

answer:  Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month. It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so it takes Amber 2 months to earn a badge. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges every month.

In a 1 year time frame, there are 12 months.

Claire earns 1 badge every month, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes 2 months to earn a badge, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges / 2 months per badge = 6 badges.

Wendy earns 3 badges every month, so in 12 months, she earns 3 badges per month * 12 months = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

The answer is 30.

\[ \text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} \approx 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we need to find the speed of a whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ \text{Speed of a whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

Thus, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

2. Determine the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell.
3. Find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.

First, we know that the total number of glasses sold by all three boys is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell is:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses and Mitchell also sold 9 glasses.

Now, we find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit.
2. Determine the number of microphones that will fit.
3. Calculate the number of pairs that can be formed from the microphones that will fit.

First, let's find the number of microphones that won't fit:

20% of 50 microphones = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

Next, we calculate the number of microphones that will fit:

Total microphones = 50
Microphones that won't fit = 10
Microphones that will fit = 50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Finally, we determine the number of pairs that can be formed from the microphones that will fit. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that will fit by 2:

Number of pairs = Microphones that will fit / 2
Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

To make a profit of $2000, Isaias's total revenue must be:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the total cost of the chickens he bought must be $7000. Therefore, the cost per chicken is:
\[ \frac{7000}{180} = 38.89 \text{ dollars per chicken} \]

So, Isaias bought each chicken he took to the market for sale for $38.89.

answer:  First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:

\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we know that Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( x \). Since she eats two carrots every day, the total cost for the carrots is \( 2x \).

The total cost for the carrots, salad, and yogurt is given by the equation:

\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 11 - 9 \]

\[ 2x = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{2}{2} \]

\[ x = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays \boxed{1} for one carrot every day.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the number of remaining plants:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of plants that are flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

answer:  Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let \( y \) be the number of years from now.

In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + y \). We want this age to be thrice her present age:
\[ 8 + y = 3x \]

Substituting \( x = 8 \):
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age of 8.

- On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesday. Since they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday, they make \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas on Friday.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on these three days:

\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} \]

\[ 125 + 125 = 250 \]

2. She mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.
   - Earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \(3 \times $6 = $18\)
3. She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.
   - Earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \(5 \times $6 = $30\)

Now, let's add up all the earnings from mowing lawns:
- Total earnings from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from the total earnings:

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Denise read:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages, so today she read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages.
- Total pages Denise read: \( 10 + 18 = 28 \) pages.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Daniel read:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel did not read any pages.
- Total pages Daniel read: \( 13 + 0 = 13 \) pages.

Now, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:
- Denise read 28 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.
- Difference: \( 28 - 13 = 15 \) pages.

Therefore, Denise read \boxed{15} more pages than Daniel.

First, let's find the total number of times Deepa has seen the movies:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- She has seen each movie 3 times.
- Total times seen = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 times.

Next, we know she spent $216 in total.

Now, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of times to find the average price per ticket:
- Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total times seen
- Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

Let's perform the division:
- $216 / 27 = $8.00

Next, determine how many tune-ups he needs, given that he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.

answer:  Calvin has enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. He has 2 adults and 2 children, so he needs enough soup for 2 adults + 2 children = 4 people.

Since he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.

If he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls, then he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls.
If he has enough soup for 8 child's bowls, then he has enough soup for 8 child's bowls.

Since he needs enough soup for 4 people, he needs enough soup for 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.

If he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls, then he has enough soup for 4 adult's bowls.
If he has enough soup for 8 child's bowls, then he has enough soup for 8 child's bowls.

Since he has enough soup for 8 child's bowls, each child can have 8 child's bowls / 2 children = 4 bowls of soup.

answer:  The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.
The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In a month with 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.
Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * $6 = $259200.
The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * $6 = $194400.
The difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000 is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

answer:  To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students in each activity.

1. Students playing tennis: 6
2. Students playing volleyball: Twice the number of tennis players, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
3. Boys playing soccer: 16
4. Girls playing soccer: 22

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 6 + 12 + 16 + 22 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the cake and the balloons:

- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost for 12 balloons is (12/2) * $0.5 = $3.

The total cost for the cake and balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream:

- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they spent:

- Total spent = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total spent = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, their combined allowance is $28. Therefore, each of them received $28 / 2 = $14.

So, each of them each received $14.

answer:  To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total 24 hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
3. Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the total time spent on these activities:
- Sleeping: 10 hours
- Working: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on these activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

Next, we subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total hours in a day to find the free time:
- Total hours in a day: 24 hours
- Total time spent on activities: 19 hours

Free time = 24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

The answer is 5.

answer:  To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of years she has been collecting shells and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

1. Calculate the number of years Martha has been collecting shells:
   - Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.
   - By her 10th birthday, she will be 10 years old.
   - Therefore, she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

2. Calculate the number of months in 5 years:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, in 5 years, there are 5 * 12 = 60 months.

3. Calculate the total number of shells Martha will have collected:
   - Martha collects 1 shell every month.
   - Therefore, in 60 months, she will have collected 60 shells.

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   - Number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   - Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   - Number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has 1/3 the number of fish he has.
   - Number of gerbils = 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets

answer:  Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).

Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

Original price of each CD: $15
Discount: 40%
Discount amount per CD: $15 * 0.40 = $6
Discounted price per CD: $15 - $6 = $9

Total cost for 10 CDs: 10 CDs * $9 per CD = $90

Next, let's calculate the total amount James received from selling the 5 CDs he didn't like:

Number of CDs sold: 5
Selling price per CD: $40
Total amount received: 5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200

Now, let's calculate the net amount James spent:

Total cost for 10 CDs: $90
Total amount received from selling CDs: $200
Net amount spent: $90 - $200 = -$110

Since the net amount spent is negative, it means James was out of $110 more than he spent.

Therefore, James was out of $110.

answer:  To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to calculate the total number of trips he needs to make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by that number.

First, let's find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours to make one trip, we divide the total time by the time for one trip:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we know the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total. To find out how many berries he can pick up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip.

He has also seen 8 movies on other days, which cost 8 * $7 = $56.
He has bought 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost 2 * $8 = $16.
He has bought 4 boxes of candy, which cost 4 * $2 = $8.
So far, he has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.
Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy for the last movie, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.
He has $150 to spend in total, so he has $150 - $130 - $10 = $10 left.
Since he can only buy one popcorn and a box of candy for the last movie, he can see $10 / $10 = 1 more movie.
Therefore, he can see a total of 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 14 movies.

First, let's find out how many slices Abby and Josh eat per day:
- Abby eats 2 slices a day.
- Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices consumed per day by both Abby and Josh:
- Total slices per day = Abby's slices per day + Josh's slices per day
- Total slices per day = 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day

Now, we need to find out how many days the 24 slices of bread will last if they consume 6 slices per day:
- Total slices of bread = 24
- Total slices per day = 6

Number of days = Total slices of bread / Total slices per day
Number of days = 24 / 6 = 4 days

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.
- Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

answer:  First, we need to determine how much water is initially in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate:

\[ \text{Initial water in the tank} = \frac{10000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used over the 6 days. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be \( 2000 \) gallons of water remaining in the tank.

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[ \text{Total patients} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks. Assuming each patient requires one bed:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

Next, calculate the cost of a 19-hour stay with the additional rate:
- First 12 hours: 1000 pesos
- Additional 7 hours: 7 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 490 pesos
- Total cost for 19-hour stay: 1000 pesos + 490 pesos = 1490 pesos

Now, find the difference in cost between the 24-hour stay and the 19-hour stay:
- Difference: 1840 pesos - 1490 pesos = 350 pesos

Cameron would save 350 pesos by choosing the 19-hour stay with the additional hourly rate.

answer:  To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- Speed of the bus: 60 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the bus: 5 hours
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- Speed of the car: 30 miles per hour
- Time traveled by the car: 8 hours
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
- Distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles
- Distance traveled by the car: 240 miles
- Difference in distance = 300 miles - 240 miles = 660 miles

Therefore, the bus went 660 miles farther than the car.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{660} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children per school and then multiply by the number of schools.

1. Calculate the number of children per school:
   - There are 8 children in each row.
   - There are 7 rows per school.
   - Therefore, the number of children per school is:
     \[
     8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school}
     \]

2. Calculate the total number of children in all schools:
   - There are 5 schools.
   - Therefore, the total number of children in all schools is:
     \[
     56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children}
     \]

So, there can be 280 children in the drill.

answer:  To determine the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to calculate the labor cost, the cost of parts, and the visit charge.

1. **Labor Cost:**
   - Patty charges $35 per hour for labor.
   - The job took 2.25 hours.
   - Labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours = $<<35*2.25=78.75>>78.75.

2. **Cost of Parts:**
   - The cost of parts is $60.

3. **Visit Charge:**
   - The visit charge is $40.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total charge:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Cost of Parts} + \text{Visit Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = \$78.75 + \$60 + \$40 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = \$178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the visit and the repair job.

answer:  To determine the total number of balls the coach brought to practice, we need to establish the number of balls carried by each boy and then sum them up.

1. **Jason's Balls:**
   - Jason carried 2 balls.

2. **Jordan's Balls:**
   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.
   - Therefore, Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.

3. **Jeffrey's Balls:**
   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.
   - Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried \(\frac{2}{2} = 1\) ball.

Now, we sum up the balls carried by all three boys:
- Jason: 2 balls
- Jordan: 4 balls
- Jeffrey: 1 ball

Total balls carried by the three boys:
\[ 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 \]

Since the boys picked up all the balls and carried them back to the bag, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the total number of balls carried by the boys.

Therefore, the coach brought **7 basketballs** to practice.

answer:  To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result of step 2 to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given:
- Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
- The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had.

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]
3. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490:

According to the problem:
- Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
- Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught \boxed{147} Pokemon.

- Commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal: 8% of $15 = $0.08 * $15 = $1.20

Next, calculate the total commission for each type of newspaper:

- Total commission from the New York Times: 6 copies * $0.50/copy = $3.00
- Total commission from the Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * $1.20/copy = $12.00

Finally, add the total commission from both types of newspapers to find the total commission:

- Total commission: $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

So, Cayley will earn a total of $15.00 in commission from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, costing $5 and $15 respectively.

According to the problem:
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by the team is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes him to swim this distance:
He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as his swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, he finishes the remaining 20 miles at half the speed of 2 miles per hour, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
The time to finish the remaining 20 miles is 20 / 1 = 20 hours.

answer:  To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to adjust for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney reported that the audience was 48, which is 20% more than the actual number. This means that the reported number is 120% of the actual number.

We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ \text{Reported number} = 1.20 \times x \]

Given that the reported number is 48, we can set up the equation:
\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Calculating the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \( \boxed{40} \).

Next, let's determine how old Emil's brother will be when he turns 24. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, his brother's age will be:

\[ \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

So, his brother will be 12 years old when Emil turns 24.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now:

\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{22}\).

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug in the first three days:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes in the first three days = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

Next, we need to account for the holes filled in on the third day:
- Holes filled in on the third day: 2 holes

Total holes by the end of the third day = 31 - 2 = 29 holes

On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10 holes

Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes

Now, we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day:
- Holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes by the end of the fourth day - Total holes by the end of the third day = 40 - 29 = 11 holes

answer:  Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. 

On that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking from the total time she was awake.

Total time awake = 5:55 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. = 5 hours and 55 minutes = 5 * 60 + 55 = 335 minutes

Time spent sleepwalking = 23 minutes

Time slept on the bed = Total time awake - Time spent sleepwalking
Time slept on the bed = 335 minutes - 23 minutes = 312 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 312 minutes.

answer:  To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots.
3. Divide the total size by 2 to find the average.

First, let's find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we calculate:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots:

\[ \text{Total size} = \text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Finally, we divide the total size by 2 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15.

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had:

1. She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, let's find out how many brownies were eaten during the party:

1. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the number of brownies left over:

1. Total brownies initially: 66
2. Brownies eaten: 18

Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

answer:  To determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of episodes.
2. Determine the total duration of each episode.
3. Multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode to find the total time.

First, let's find the number of episodes:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

So, the number of episodes is:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Total minutes per episode}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know each episode is 20 minutes long.

Now, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Duration per episode} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John will spend **200 minutes** watching the show if he watches every episode.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, so 4 sunflowers will use \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, so 10 carnations will use \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

Next, we subtract the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil in the bag to find out how much soil is left for the roses:

- Total soil in the bag: 30 pounds
- Soil used by sunflowers and carnations: 27 pounds
- Soil left for roses: \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is equal to the amount of soil left, which is 3 roses.

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses.

Next, we know that Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey. Therefore, Collins received:

\[ 140 \text{ corn chips} + 15 \text{ corn chips} = 155 \text{ corn chips} \]

Now, we add up the total number of corn chips received by all three:

answer:  Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so 4 boxes contain 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

After giving away 4 boxes, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so 8 boxes contain 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

She sold the rest of the oranges, which is 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

The total cost of the books is:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has saved $14. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours to work = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $25 / $5

Hours to work = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

   - Time: 10 hours
   - Distance: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second segment (north):**
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours

3. **Third segment (south):**
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Distance: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we sum the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:

300 miles (south) + 36 miles (north) + 110 miles (south) = 446 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.

answer:  To find the total cost of both cars, we first need to determine the price of the red car. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find the price of the red car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40

2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the price of the red car:
   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60
   \]

Now, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160
\]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $\$160.

Next, let's determine the total number of slices each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets 2 slices. There are 2 adults, so the total number of slices for the adults is 2 * 2 = 4.

Now, let's find the total number of slices in the family. The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the slices for the adults, which is 4 + 4 = 8.

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult gets 2 slices out of the total 8 slices. To find the percentage, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and then multiply by 100:

answer:  First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Since each plant is 12 inches wide and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant, the total number of plants needed is:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44 \text{ plants} \]

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:
\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 to fill up her flower bed completely.

answer:  To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to break down the costs and earnings.

1. **Daily Earnings:**
   - The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
   - The cost per student per session is $1.50.
   - There are 10 students, so the total cost for students per session is \( 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost per session is \( 25 + 15 = 40 \) dollars.

2. **Weekly Earnings:**
   - The dance studio is rented 3 days a week.
   - So, the weekly earnings are \( 40 \times 3 = 120 \) dollars.

3. **Monthly Earnings:**
   - Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the monthly earnings are \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner:

1. **Low mode (3 hours):**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Cooling effect: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

2. **High mode (4 hours):**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Cooling effect: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

3. **Off period (2 hours):**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Warming effect: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net cooling effect:
- Total cooling effect: 6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Since the net cooling effect is 14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

answer:  First, let's determine the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, given that 1 serving is 3 pounds.

To find the number of servings, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the weight per serving:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 0.25 \times 2,000.00 = 500.00 \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money she sets aside in a year. There are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500.00 \times 12 = 6,000.00 \]

Now, determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6,000.00}{1,000.00} = 6 \]

Since Jessica cannot buy a fraction of a pair of shoes, she can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

Therefore, Jessica can buy \( 6 \) pairs of shoes in a year.

answer:  To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

1. Calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.
2. Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

First, we know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many as Edgar. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily number of pretzels by 7:

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ pretzels per week} \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the water she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.
In total, Wanda pumped 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons, and Ms. B pumped 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.

1. **Electric bill**: 1 check per month
2. **Gas bill**: 1 check per month
3. **Church**: 2 checks per month
4. **Pest and lawn service**: 1 check every 3 months (which is equivalent to 1 check every 3 months)

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month
- Gas bill: 1 check per month
- Church: 2 checks per month
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months

Now, let's sum these up:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find the time to cook 90 shrimp by multiplying the cooking time for 30 shrimp by 3:

\[ \text{Time to cook} = 10 \text{ minutes} \times 3 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time to peel the shrimp and the time to cook them to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, let's find the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Next, we know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 chocolate bars / 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box.

- Akbar's age: 3
- Alessandro's age: 4
- Total age of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
- Total age of the children: 20
- Number of children: 4
- Average age of the group: 20 / 4 = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
- Helene's age: 2 * 5 = 10

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the children:
- Total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene: 7 + 10 = 17
- Total age of the children: 20
- Wilfred's age: 20 - 17 = 3

Wilfred is therefore 3 years old.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout the day. Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

Since the first plane makes 88 trips in one day, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \).

Thus, the first plane takes 22 flights to France in one day.

Therefore, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

answer:  To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the cost per sandwich based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the cost per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the package with 8 sandwiches:
- The cost per sandwich is $1.50.
- The package has 8 sandwiches.
- Total cost = Cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
- Total cost = $1.50 * 8 = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

answer:  To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for each step and then subtract that from the desired finish time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (2 * 60 = 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Since 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

answer:  To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, calculate the distance Matteo traveled:
- Matteo's speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Next, calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
- Shandy's speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, find the difference in distance between Shandy and Matteo:
Difference = Distance Shandy - Distance Matteo
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

answer:  To determine how long James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages of his book. We know that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

First, let's find out how many pages James can read in 1 minute. If he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then in 1 minute he reads:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ pages per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to read 18 pages. Since he reads 0.3 pages per minute, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{0.3 \text{ pages per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18}{0.3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year.

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines} = 30 \times 4 \times 12 = 480
\]

Finally, we add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population of porcupines to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 480 = 530
\]

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will

answer:  To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available in the Fine Arts Center.
2. Subtract the number of seats for faculty from the total number of seats.
3. Divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

First, let's find the total number of seats available:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 6000 \]

Next, subtract the number of seats for faculty:
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = \text{Total seats} - \text{Faculty seats} \]
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 6000 - 300 = 5700 \]

Now, divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Remaining seats}}{\text{Number of graduates}} \]
\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{5700}{950} = 6 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 6 tickets.

answer:  Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost in the first 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 9\% = 45\% \]

During the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, the charge lost in the next 3 hours is:
\[ 3 \times 7\% = 21\% \]

The total charge lost over the 8 hours is:
\[ 45\% + 21\% = 66\% \]

The remaining charge after 8 hours is given as 28%. Therefore, the initial charge \( x \) can be calculated as follows:
\[ x - 66\% = 28\% \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 28\% + 66\% \]
\[ x = 94\% \]

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

answer:  Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs $12.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( S = 2L \).
4. The total earnings from the sales were $120.

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substitute \( S = 2L \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \):
\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

 Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

2. Determine the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles:
- The driveway is 24 feet wide.
- Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.

To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know that it takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 bottles, the total time is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

answer:  First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe.

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

1. One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
2. 40 dwarves will mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.
3. In a month with 30 days, they will mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

- Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
- Area of one piece of fabric = Length * Width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- Total area needed = 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of tennis balls retrieved is the sum of the balls in all three sets:

Combine like terms:
\[ 3x + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

answer:  To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat.
2. Determine the relationship between medium-sized beans and small beans.
3. Calculate the number of small beans Grandpa can eat.

First, we know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the relationship between medium-sized beans and small beans is:
\[ 1 \text{ medium-sized bean} = 3 \text{ small beans} \]

Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, the number of small beans he can eat is:
\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[ 450 \]

Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed over the 4 years: $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

Next, determine how much money Jim lost by not working during those 4 years: $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

Now, calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loans and the lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new annual income is: $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

Finally, determine how long it will take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new annual income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

answer:  To determine how much James pays a year for his insurance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 per month.
- The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

Now, add this to the normal cost to get the increased monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $192.

Next, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

answer:  To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all three cats.

Each cat is fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/feed} \times 2 \text{ feeds/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

answer:  To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as Tuesday.
   - Twice 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the answer is 736 letters.

answer:  To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost or won, we need to calculate the total amount lost or won and then divide by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. Since he lost $5, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost or won:
- Total lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50
- Total won: $11

The net loss is $21.50 - $11 = $0.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost per race is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Subtract her daily parking expenses from her daily pay.
3. Divide the net daily pay by the total number of hours to find the hourly pay.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract her daily parking expenses from her daily pay:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} - 3 \text{ dollars/day} = 12 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, we divide the net daily pay by the total number of hours to find the hourly pay:

answer:  To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
2. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:

- There are 7 days in a week.
- The team worked for 3 weeks, so the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Each day, the team worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day, which is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.

So, the total number of hours worked by the team is:
\[ 21 \times 9 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours per painter:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in \(47.25\) hours of work.

answer:  Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

   - Each king-size bed requires 1 set of sheets.
   - Therefore, he uses \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) set of king sheets per week.

   - Total sets of sheets per week: \( 8 + 1 = 9 \) sets.

2. **Annual Sheets Usage:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total sets of sheets per year: \( 9 \times 52 = 468 \) sets.

answer:  First, let's determine the total cost of the 15 roses. Since each rose costs $2, the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jenny has. She paid with five 5 dollar bills, so:

\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5 \text{ per bill} = \$25 \]

Now, let's find out how much change Jenny should receive after buying the roses:

\[ \$35 - \$30 = \$5 \]

Since the florist only gives quarters as change, we need to convert the change into quarters. We know that each quarter is worth $0.25. To find out how many quarters make up $5, we divide $5 by $0.25:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]

answer:  To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add the number of stickers he collected each year to the initial number of stickers he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year.

First, let's calculate the number of stickers Leo collected this year:
- Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
- This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, let's add up all the stickers Leo has collected over the years:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, Leo has a total of 250 stickers in his collection now.

The answer is \(\boxed{250}\).

answer:  To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to add up the costs of each item she bought.

1. **Tank Top**: $10
2. **Running Shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis Shoes**: Originally $48, on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic Socks**: Originally $8, with a coupon for $2 off, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, we add up all the costs:

\[ 10 \text{ (Tank Top)} + 15 \text{ (Running Shorts)} + 24 \text{ (Tennis Shoes)} + 6 \text{ (Athletic Socks)} \]

Adding these together:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]

\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices and Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

answer:  Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, which is $2000 * 0.75 = $1500.
He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.
The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is calculated as follows:

Percentage Discount = (Original Price - Selling Price) / Original Price * 100
Percentage Discount = ($2000 - $1800) / $2000 * 100
Percentage Discount = $200 / $2000 * 100
Percentage Discount = 0.10 * 100
Percentage Discount = 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is 10%.

answer:  To determine how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply by 4.

First, let's calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend:
- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
- On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday. Therefore, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies on Sunday.

So, the total number of movies they watch in one weekend is:
\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Next, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since there are 2 weekends in a week, in 4 weeks there will be:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekends/week} = 8 \text{ weekends} \]

Therefore, the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, let's find the savings by comparing the cost of buying individually to the cost of buying in bunches:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

answer:  Let's denote the time it took for Donovan's part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of the time it took for Betsy's part and Donovan's part, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part of the meal took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the total number of meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

So, there are 28 meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches she has is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

answer:  To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck over a 6-hour day.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
- Bales left = Bales produced - Bales picked up
- Bales left = 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

answer:  To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest waterslide: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest waterslide: 80 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in one day is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

Over a week (7 days), the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys is:
24 bananas/day * 7 days = 168 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey. Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas in total, so the number of bananas left for the third monkey is:
315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas.

Since the third monkey eats the remaining bananas for a week, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is:
147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas per day.

#### 21 bananas per day.

answer:  To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs to save.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of weeks needed to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks.

answer:  Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( x \).

We are given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{x}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \]

We are also given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This includes both the large jellyfish that change color and the small jellyfish that also change color (since the problem does not specify that small jellyfish do not change color). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ x = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \).

answer:  Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence between Sam and Harry is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The total amount of fence between Sam and Harry is 100 feet, so the amount left over for Sam is:
\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \text{ feet} \]

Sam has 20 feet left over.

answer:  James initially walked to the store, which is 4 miles away. When he got halfway there, he realized he forgot something and had to walk back home. 

First, let's calculate the total distance James walked:
- Halfway to the store: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles
- Back home: 2 miles

Total distance = 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
- Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour

Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store.

answer:  To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total school population. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population as \( P \).

Given:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } P = 240 \]

We can write this as:
\[ 0.40P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Next, we know that the number of girls is the remaining 60% of the school population. Therefore, we calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

answer:  To determine Frankie's score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Binkie's score.
2. Calculate Frankie's score based on the given relationship.

Given:
- Binkie's score = 90
- Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.

Let's denote Frankie's score as \( F \).

According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this relationship as:
\[ F = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substitute Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Then, add 15 to 180:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is:
\[ F = 195 \]

Frankie's score is 195.

answer:  Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( T \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is \( \frac{T}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, so we have the equation:
   \[
   \frac{T}{4} = 270
   \]

4. To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
   \[
   T = 270 \times 4

   \[
   T = 1080

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} \]
\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years:
\[ \text{Total growth} = \text{Growth rate per year} \times \text{Number of years} \]
\[ \text{Total growth} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} \]
\[ \text{Total growth} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

answer:  Anna had a budget of $16 and had already spent $4. She bought 2 books, and she has $2 left in her budget.

First, let's determine how much money Anna spent on the books:
\[ \text{Amount spent on books} = \text{udget} - \text{amount spent} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on books} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, we know that Anna has $2 left in her budget after buying the books. Therefore, the total amount spent on the books is:
\[ \text{Amount spent on books} - \text{amount left} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent on books} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Since Anna bought 2 books, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent by 2:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent on books}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

1. Calculate the height from which the ball is initially dropped.
2. Determine the height of the first bounce.
3. Determine the height of the second bounce.

First, calculate the height from which the ball is initially dropped:
- The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
- Each story is 24 feet high.
- Therefore, the initial height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

Next, calculate the height of the first bounce:
- The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
- So, the height of the first bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48\) feet.

Finally, calculate the height of the second bounce:
- The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height of the first bounce.
- So, the height of the second bounce is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32\) feet.

The answer is \(32\) feet.

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discounted price of the frying pan is:

$20.00 * 0.80 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discounted price of the towels is:

$30.00 * 0.90 = $27.00

The total cost of the frying pan and towels is:

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Adding this to her current balance:

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

Sheila's new balance is $113.00.

answer:  To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people from the cars and the number of people from the buses, then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of people from the cars:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Total people from cars = 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

Next, let's calculate the number of people from the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Total people from buses = 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

Now, we add the total number of people from the cars and the buses to find the total number of people inside the church:
- Total people inside the church = Total people from cars + Total people from buses
- Total people inside the church = 60 people + 420 people = 480 people.

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 480.

answer:  To determine how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the pots and garden soil before applying the coupon.
2. Subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost:
- The cost of the pots is $19.
- The cost of the garden soil is $26.

Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26 = $45.

Next, we subtract the value of the coupon:
- The coupon is worth $7.

Total cost after coupon = $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

answer:  To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Micah ran.
2. Subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find Ahito's distance.

First, let's calculate the distance Micah ran:
Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the total distance run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = \text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three to find out Ahito's distance:
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran \boxed{16} miles.

answer:  Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

First, let's calculate the total distance she plans to hike in June:
\[ 2 \text{ hikes/day} \times 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Since she has 30 days left in June, we need to determine how many more miles she needs to hike per day:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

answer:  First, we need to determine the distance to John's parents' house. Since he drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to get there, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a month. The distance for one trip is 140 miles, and he makes two trips per month:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance per trip} \times \text{Number of trips} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 140 \, \text{miles/trip} \times 2 \, \text{trips} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John drives 280 miles in a month.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount on $40 is:

\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, let's determine the total number of bagels in the 4 packs. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs will contain:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

Therefore, each single bagel will cost $1.00 after the discount.

The answer is:

answer:  Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is \( \frac{S}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, which is \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.

Since \( \frac{S}{4} \) is the number of stickers Luis gave to Kris, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers in the beginning.

answer:  To determine how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} \approx 9.02 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take approximately 9.02 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so they produce a total of 6 + 6 = 12 toys per hour.
The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so they produce a total of 4 + 4 = 8 toys per hour.

Together, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

In a 10-hour shift, they produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order. Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced 400 - 20 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can find their production rate by dividing the number of toys produced by the number of hours worked:

180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

Next, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) be the distance Brian will walk in seven days.
Since Sofie's distance is twice Brian's distance, we can write:
\[ 2B = 70 \text{ miles} \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

answer:  To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- He then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Sid took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles.
- He took 3 hours to travel the additional 140 miles.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

answer:  To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the Earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, let's find half of the circumference of the Earth:
\[ \text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. We do this by dividing the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

answer:  Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as \( x \).

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

answer:  To find the total duration of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of each song and then sum them up.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Now, add the lengths of both songs to find the total duration of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total duration of the cassette is \boxed{13} minutes.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops} \]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops:

answer:  Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \( A = S \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

Since \( A = S \), we can substitute \( S \) with \( A \) in the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ C + A = 30 \]
\[ 2A = 30 \]
\[ A = 15 \]

Now, we know \( C = A + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27 \).

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract \( A \) from \( C \):
\[ C - A = 27 - 15 = 12 \]

So, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

answer:  First, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

The total number of parts in the ratio is \(5 + 9 = 14\).

To find the number of passengers per part, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women by multiplying the number of parts by the number of passengers per part:
- Number of men: \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women: \(9 \times 6 = 54\)

So, initially, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus.

Next, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach.
   - She spends 40 minutes on the beach.

2. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - She walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
   - Since she spends 40 minutes on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is half of that.
   - Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time spent on the sidewalk: 20 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \( \boxed{60} \) minutes.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added over three weeks:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.
- Number of cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added over three weeks:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.
- Number of chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the sum of the temperatures of the water from both mugs.

The temperature of the water from the 33-degree mug is \( 33 \) degrees per ounce for 4 ounces, which is \( 33 \times 4 = 132 \) degrees.

The temperature of the water from the second mug is \( x \) degrees per ounce for 1 ounce, which is \( x \) degrees.

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is \( 132 + x \) degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water if it is at least 40 degrees, we set up the inequality:

\[ 132 + x \geq 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x \geq 40 - 132 \]
\[ x \geq -92 \]

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be at least \( -92 \) degrees.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores (1/4) * 2 = 1 goal.
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by both teams:
- Team A: 4 goals in the first half + 1 goal in the second half = 5 goals.
- Team B: 2 goals in the first half + 8 goals in the second half = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 5 goals by team A + 10 goals by team B = 15 goals.

The answer is 15 goals.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of sunflowers sold per day. We know that Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and each sunflower costs $2.

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, let's determine the number of bouquets sold per day. We know that Faraday earned $56 from bouquets and each bouquet costs $8.

\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 7 \times 12 = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days.

1. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist.
2. Determine the total number of teeth James has.
3. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed.

First, let's find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:
- The dentist drills 4 teeth.
- The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \( 4 + 7 = 11 \) teeth.

Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Next, we know that James has 30 teeth in total.

Now, we calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
- Total carrots on weekdays on weekdays = 5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots.

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).
- Mason eats 5 carrots each weekend day.
- Total carrots on weekends = 2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots.

Now, we add the total number of carrots from weekdays and weekends:
- Total carrots in a week = 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekends) = 30 carrots.

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + (B + 7) + 4B = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

answer:  To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, each bottle covers 0.20 of a person's daily energy needs.

To cover the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 0.20 \text{ bottles/person} = 4600 \text{ bottles} \]

The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed to reach 4600 bottles, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 4600 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 400 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce an additional 400 bottles of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so in 60 minutes, 2 * (15/60) = 1/2 snowballs melt.
Therefore, in 60 minutes, Jay gains 1/3 - 1/2 = 1/6 snowballs.
To find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many 60-minute intervals it will take for him to gain 60 snowballs.
Since Jay gains 1/6 snowballs every 60 minutes, it will take him 60 / (1/6) = 3600 minutes to gain 60 snowballs.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take Jay 3600 / 60 = 60 hours to have 60 snowballs.

So, the amount of chalk left after Monday is:

\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Now, the teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days he can use the remaining chalk, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount he uses each day:

\[ \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{0.20 \text{ inches/day}} = 13.75 \text{ days} \]

The total amount of paint used is given as 12 pints. Therefore, the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is \( \frac{x}{2} \) pints.

The equation representing the total amount of paint used is:
\[ x + x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3x + \frac{x}{2} = 12 \]
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 12 \]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:

answer:  First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially has:
\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
So, he uses 20 bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ bills} \]

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill is equivalent to 2 5 dollar bills:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ 5 dollar bills} \]

Therefore, Thomas has:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

answer:  Let's denote the amount of money Rissa initially had as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Let's denote the amount of money Rissa gave to her little sister as \( x \). Therefore, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his little sister. Ronnie initially had $5, so after giving $3 to his little sister, he has:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ronnie has $2 left.

\( \boxed{2} \)

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
   - His children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons.

4. **Fourth Day:**
   - There are 3 people at the party.
   - They share the remaining root beer equally.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons.

So, each person gets \( \frac{8}{3} \) gallons of root beer.

To express this as a decimal:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons} \]

Each person gets approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

answer:  To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
2. Use the information about John's age when Digimon came out to find Jim's age at that time.
3. Calculate Jim's current age based on the information given.

First, we find John's age when Digimon came out. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary and John is currently 28, his age when Digimon came out was:
\[ 28 - 20 = 8 \]

Next, we know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim's age when Digimon came out was:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Now, we need to find Jim's current age. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, another 20 years have passed since then. Therefore, Jim's current age is:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

So, Jim is currently 24 years old.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]

answer:  To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can receive.

First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{27000}{500} = 540
\]

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can receive:

\[
\text{Number of books per school} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of schools}} = \frac{540}{3} = 180
\]

Therefore, Bob can buy 180 books per school.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. A regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ \text{Number of pods in the special size box} = 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1. Since the special size box costs $12, we can calculate the cost per pod:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1:

\[ \text{Number of pods for $1} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.

First, let's calculate the number of red pens:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of black pens:
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.
- Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) packs of black pens.
- Each pack contains 5 pens.
- Therefore, the total number of black pens is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
- Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
- Total number of pens = 25 + 50 = 75.

Alain has 75 pens in total.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages left.

On the second day, they used 30 bandages, so they had \( (x + 12) - 30 = x - 18 \) bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages, so they had \( (x - 18) + 25 = x + 7 \) bandages left.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so \( x + 7 = 78 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 7 \]
\[ x = 71 \]

Therefore, the nurses started with 71 bandages on the first day.

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

   - Colin's age seven years from now is \( C + 7 \).
   - Wendy's current age is \( 5(C + 7) \).

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - Colin's age in 25 years will be \( C + 25 \).
   - Wendy's age in 25 years will be \( 5(C + 7) + 25 = 5C + 50 \).
   - According to the problem, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 50) \).

Let's solve the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 50}{3} \]
\[ 3C = 5C + 50 \]
\[ -2C = 50 \]
\[ C = 25 \]

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

To find the total number of trees planted over the two days, we add the number of trees planted on each day:

First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

Total trees planted: 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees

- Cleaning his room: 1 time * $1.50 per time = $1.50

Now, let's sum up his weekly earnings:

Weekly earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Since Jason worked over a two-week period, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

Two-week earnings = $9.00 * 2 = $18.00

answer:  To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to determine the capacity of each school and then sum them up.

1. **Ali's School:**
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

2. **John's School:**
   - John's school has two classes.
   - Each class in John's school has \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the capacity of Ali's class.
   - Therefore, the capacity of each class in John's school is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \) students.
   - Since John's school has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) students.

3. **Combined Capacity:**
   - The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacity of Ali's school and John's school.
   - Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school
   - Combined capacity = 120 students + 30 students = 150 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

answer:  Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so she had:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so she had:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she now has:
\[ 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

So, after using 3 colors from one makeup set, she has:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ colors} \]

Since she has two makeup sets left, she has:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ colors} \]

Adding the remaining colors from the palettes, she has:
\[ 7 + 6 = 13 \text{ colors} \]

answer:  To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break down the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.

2. **Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute for the remaining 20 minutes is $0.2.
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.

3. **Total cost of the 36-minute call:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4 + $4 = $8

Therefore, a 36-minute call would cost $8.

answer:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is $600/10 = $<<600/10=60>>60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 10*2 = 20 bottles.

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60*0.5) = $<<60+(60*0.5)=90>>90.

The total cost for the scotch is 10 bottles * $60 = $<<10*60=600>>600.

The total cost for the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 = $<<20*90=1800>>1800.

Therefore, John spends $600 + $1800 = $<<600+1800=2400>>2400 on everything.

answer:  When the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of passengers 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. So, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus, making the total number of passengers 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so the total number of passengers became 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and it currently has 180 passengers. Therefore, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

To fill these remaining spaces, we need 20 more people.

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 180 current passengers + 20 additional passengers = 200.

\[ \text{Loan} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan:

\[ \text{Amount used for debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Now, calculate how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts. Subtract the amount used for debts from the loan:

\[ \text{Leftover money} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

answer:  To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. The first 3 magazines each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. The fourth magazine sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. The fifth magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[
36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues}
\]

Since each magazine is a separate entity, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is the same as the number of magazines she ordered:
\[
3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \text{ magazines}
\]

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 5 magazines every year.

answer:  First, we need to determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Next, we find out how many fish are remaining after accounting for the fish with red stripes:

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we calculate how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:

\[ \text{Total number of fish with either red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes is 42.

answer:  Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ \text{Length of the longer piece} = 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \boxed{32} feet.

2. Subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons to find out how many balloons were thrown.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons initially:
- There are 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.

So, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

Let's add them step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, divide this sum by the number of quizzes (which is 9):

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he travels for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he has traveled:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, we find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that he has covered:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Pauline continues to visit the museum for 3 more years.

Number of visits in the next 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits
Total cost for the next 3 years = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45

To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we add the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Total amount spent = $30 + $45 = $75

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum.

answer:  To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother.
2. Calculate the number of grapes used by their mother to make the pies.
3. Add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother to find the total number of grapes at the beginning.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.
3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, she used \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) grapes.

Now, we add up the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother:
- Madeline: 6 grapes
- Brother: 30 grapes
- Mother: 48 grapes

Total grapes at the beginning = \( 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \)

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was \boxed{84} grapes.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure without the discount:

- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Total cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both the manicure and pedicure:

Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art for each of her fingers:

- Nail art per nail: $3
- Number of nails: 10 (assuming she has 10 fingers)

Total cost for nail art: $3/nail * 10 nails = $30

Finally, we add the total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art:

Total cost = (manicure and pedicure after discount) + (nail art cost)
Total cost = $60 + $30 = $90

answer:  To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs.
2. Determine how many tablespoons of seasoning are needed for that amount of ground beef.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs. Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs per pound, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, we multiply the number of pounds of ground beef by the number of tablespoons per pound:

\[ \text{Tablespoons of seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

answer:  First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:
- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookshelf:
- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total capacity of one bookshelf: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookshelf:
\[ \frac{110}{55} \approx 2.0909 \]

Since Elly cannot have a fraction of a bookshelf, she will need 3 bookcases to hold all her books.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles.

2. **Dropping half of the marbles**: Brendan drops half of his marbles.
   - Half of 10 is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) marbles.
   - So, he drops 5 marbles.

3. **Marbles left after dropping**: After dropping 5 marbles, Brendan has:
   - 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left.

4. **Marbles picked up**: Brendan then picks up 3 marbles.
   - After picking up 3 marbles, he has \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) marbles.

5. **Discovering the bead**: Brendan finds that one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead.
   - He gets rid of this bead, so he subtracts 1 from the total.

6. **Final number of marbles**: After getting rid of the bead, Brendan has:
   - \( 8 - 1 = 7 \) marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ends up with \boxed{7} marbles.

\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate:

\[ \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total earnings from the veteran lessons. Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons at his reduced rate:

answer:  Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies she made is \( 3C - 2 \).

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is \( C + (3C - 2) = 4C - 2 \).

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

To solve for \( C \):
1. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4C}{4} = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
5. The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we add up the times for all six sides:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

answer:  To determine how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to use the information given: she wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year. We can express this relationship as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

answer:  To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price in December after the 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price in January after the 50% decrease.

First, let's find the price in December:
- The original price in November is $40.
- The price increased by 80% in December.
- To find the increase amount: \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \).
- Therefore, the price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

Next, let's find the price in January:
- The price in December is $72.
- The price decreased by 50% in January.
- To find the decrease amount: \( 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \).
- Therefore, the price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

- Each set of 3 eggs sells for $1, so the total revenue is \(20 \times 1 = $20.00\).

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Profit = $20.00 - $12.00
- Profit = $8.00

So, Rose's profit will be $8.00.

answer:  To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by each type of animal and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 2-legged animals.
- Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 4-legged animals.
- Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to find the total number of legs:
- Total legs = 20 (from 2-legged animals) + 60 (from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs.

So, the total number of pairs of legs on the farm is 80.

answer:  To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade uploads in one day.
2. Determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day:
- She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

So, the number of photos uploaded in one day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos:
- She has 210 photos in total.
- She uploads 42 photos each day.

So, the number of days required is:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos.

answer:  Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes  96 blueberry cubes.

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: Twice the number of red candies, so \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \)
- Yellow candies: Half the number of red candies, so \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

\[
\text{Total red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

Now, we find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag:

\[
\text{Total candies} = 232
\]
\[
\text{Total red, orange, and yellow candies} = 189
\]

\[
\text{Number of pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43
\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is \( 43 \).

2. Next 30 seconds: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels
3. Next 30 seconds: \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels
4. Final 30 seconds: \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels

Next, we calculate the total number of kernels popped during the cooking process:

\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Finally, we add the additional popped kernels to the initially popped kernels to find the total number of pieces of popcorn:

\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

- There are 4 people in the house, so each person has 1 flashlight.
- There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights.

Total flashlights = 4 people * 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 64 flashlights

Next, calculate the total number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house.
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.

Total small candles = (8/2) rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles
Total medium candles = (8/2) rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles

Total candles = 16 candles + 20 candles = 36 candles

Finally, add the total number of flashlights and candles to find the total number of light sources:

Total light sources = 64 flashlights + 36 candles = 100 light sources

Therefore, Brianna's family is using a total of 100 light sources.

answer:  Let's denote the cost of one phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \).

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones. Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 4x = 6x \]

We are given that the main phone plan costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, the cost of one phone is $10. Now, we can find the total cost of the phone plan:

\[ 6x = 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60.

answer:  To determine the force needed to move the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of the two children: 2 * 75 = 150 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. Therefore, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

Force needed = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force needed = (1/100) * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 16 pounds

So, John needs to apply a force of 16 pounds to push the car.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words:

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we can find out how long it will take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500}{375} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages of text at his trained speed.

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate how many calls Tim can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week. Since he handles 24 calls each day, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ calls} \]

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

- A Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.

Next, we calculate the total daily consumption for all the dogs:

- There are 3 German Shepherds, so they consume:
  \[
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kilograms per day}
  \]

- There are 2 Bulldogs, so they consume:

Next, determine the number of pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Since Timothy has 54 pens:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

answer:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Children:**
   - There are 5 children following the truck.

2. **On the Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by one more child.
   - Therefore, the total number of children becomes:
     \[
     5 + 5 = 10
     \]

3. **On the Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.
   - Therefore, the total number of children becomes:
     \[
     10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30
     \]

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children give up and leave the group.
   - Therefore, the number of children now following the truck is:
     \[
     30 - 5 = 25
     \]

So, the number of children now following the truck is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]

answer:  First, let's determine the total number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 6 \text{ lemons/gallon} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, we need to account for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon is:

\[ 1 \text{ gallon} \times 6 \text{ lemons/gallon} = 6 \text{ lemons} \]

Now, we add the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon to find the total number of lemons required:

\[ 24 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need a total of 30 lemons.

answer:  To find the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny.
2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells.

First, let's find the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny:

- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells:

- There were 67 cracked seashells.

Good seashells = 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665.

answer:  First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his chores. He earns $6 each week and did chores for 3 weeks:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is a total of 4 people. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream cones:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \frac{13}{6.50} \approx 2.0769 \]

Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 2 movie tickets.

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

answer:  To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point:
- Distance = √((Distance west)^2 + (Distance east)^2)
- Distance = √(90^2 + 144^2)
- Distance = √(8100 + 20736)
- Distance = √28836

Calculate the square root of 28836:
- Distance ≈ √28836
- Distance ≈ 170 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is approximately 170 miles away from his house now.

answer:  First, calculate the total time Charisma spends meditating in a week:
- She meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- In a week, there are 7 days, so 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.

Next, calculate the total time Charisma spends practicing yoga in a week:
- She practices yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
- She practices yoga 5 days a week, so 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.

Now, calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in a week:
- Total weekly time = 210 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 510 minutes/week.

Finally, calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks:
- Total time = 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

So, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks.

2. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas dropped from the total number of marbles he had before dropping any.
3. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas has now from the total number of marbles Mazie had to find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla.

First, we know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. Therefore, the total number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any is:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Next, we know that Mazie had 52 marbles in total. After giving some marbles to Dallas and Darla, the number of marbles left is:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Since the remaining marbles are divided equally between Dallas and Darla, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:
\[ 27 - 25 = 2 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave 2 marbles to Darla.

\[ 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ seeds/dozen} = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 \text{ seeds} = 0.50 \times 36 \text{ seeds} = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Finally, add the number of seeds from both types of sunflowers to find the total number of seeds:

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, so he fills in 9 * 7 = 63 holes in a week.

However, the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so he digs 6 * 7 = 42 new holes in a week.

The net number of holes filled in per week is 63 - 42 = 21 holes.

To find out how many weeks it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per week:

84 holes / 21 holes per week = 4 weeks

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we have both Mia's and Emma's ages. The average of their ages is calculated by adding their ages together and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The original price of one T-shirt is $8, and he gets a 50% discount. Therefore, the discounted price of one T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4 \]

Since Jake pays for only one T-shirt, the cost for the T-shirt is $4.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and he gets a 40% discount. Therefore, the discounted price of the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Jake spends by adding the cost of the T-shirt and the cost of the shoes:
\[ 4 + 24 = 28 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \boxed{28} dollars.

answer:  To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.
2. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.

First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- Each leg needs 2 screws.
- Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is \( 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \).

Since James is putting together 4 tables:
- The total number of screws needed is \( 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \).

Next, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has:
- James has 40 screws.
- The number of screws left over is \( 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \).

- Therefore, Jane can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges in an hour.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Thus, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

answer:  Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

First, let's determine how many toy soldiers each half represents:
- Half of 12 toy soldiers is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.
- The other half is also 6 toy soldiers.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each half:
- Earnings from the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 per toy): \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) dollars.
- Earnings from the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 per toy): \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \( 30 + 42 = 72 \) dollars.

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn $72.

answer:  First, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the small t-shirts:
\[ 11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

Then, calculate the total amount of fabric used for the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Finally, add up all the fabric amounts to find the total amount of fabric for the quilt:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the quilt is 101 square feet.

answer:  To determine how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week.
2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars.

First, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in one week:
- The company produces 5000 bars per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, in one week, the company produces \( 5000 \times 7 = 35000 \) bars.

Next, let's calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks:
- In two weeks, the company produces \( 35000 \times 2 = 70000 \) bars.

Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars:
- Each chocolate bar is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 70000 \times 2 = 140000 \) dollars.

answer:  First, let's determine the number of test tubes and Petri dishes Igor actually gathered:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: \( x \) (let's call this the number of beakers Igor lost)
- Petri dishes: 16

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is given as 29. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor lost 5 beakers.

Therefore, the number of beakers lost is \( \boxed{5} \).

answer:  First, calculate the cost of each ingredient for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Next, calculate the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 jars * $44/jar = $440

Then, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
- Total revenue = 10 jars * $50/jar = $500

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars.

answer:  To determine how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

2. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

3. **Determine the time Aaron took to run his distance:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

4. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run her distance:**
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa must run each mile half as fast as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
   - If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would run 4 miles in twice that time.
   - So, Vanessa took \( 16 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \) to complete her part of the race.

Thus, Vanessa took \( 32 \) minutes to complete her part of the race.

answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy initially has:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Next, let's account for the cookies he ate and gave away:
- He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack (one of each flavor).
- He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.
- He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Cookies eaten and given away = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7

Now, let's subtract the cookies eaten and given away from the initial total:
Cookies left = 18 - 7 = 11

Finally, let's add the cookies he baked for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 4
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 4

Cookies baked = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Total cookies after baking = 11 + 12 = 23

Therefore, Randy has 23 cookies now.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.
2. James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, let's determine John's current age.

1. John had James when he was 19, so James is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.
2. Therefore, John is \(37 - 19 = 18\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current age of John's youngest son.

1. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is \(32 - 18 = 4\) years old.

Finally, let's determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

1. John's youngest son is currently 4 years old, so in 3 years, he will be \(4 + 3 = 7\) years old.

answer:  To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then sum these amounts.

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750

3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700

Now, we sum the amounts raised by all three girls:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} = 430 + 750 + 700 = 1880

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we calculate the profit per watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price per watermelon:

\[ \text{Profit per watermelon} = 0.25 \times 1.60 = \$0.40 \]

Now, we find the selling price per watermelon by adding the profit to the cost price:

answer:  Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows.

We have two equations based on the given information:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows.

Now, substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\).
